# Contributing to AI Solutions Wiki

AI Solutions Wiki is a community knowledge base. Contributions of all kinds are welcome — new articles, corrections, deeper citations, and real-world solution examples.

## How to Contribute

### Add or improve a solution article

Solution articles live in `content/solutions/<industry>/`. Each article documents a specific AI use case with:
- The business problem
- The AI approach and architecture
- AWS / Azure / GCP implementation options
- Where the approach works well and where it breaks

To add a solution:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new `.md` file under the appropriate industry folder
3. Follow the frontmatter structure from an existing solution article
4. Submit a pull request

### Improve a tool or framework article

Tool articles live in `content/tools/`. You can:
- Add missing `alternatives:` frontmatter (open-source, AWS, Azure, GCP alternatives)
- Add `solutions:` frontmatter linking to solution articles that use this tool
- Expand the article content with additional use cases or configuration examples
- Add a `## Sources` section with primary citations

### Add a glossary definition

Glossary articles live in `content/glossary/`. Good additions:
- Foundational ML/AI/CS terms that lack proper citation to the original paper
- Practical guidance for technical decision-makers
- Cross-references (`related:` frontmatter) to related terms and guides

### Fix content errors

If you find an inaccuracy — a wrong date, misattributed paper, or factually incorrect technical claim — please open a pull request with a correction and a source citation.

## Style Guide

- Write for a technically literate audience (software engineers, architects, technical leads)
- Cite primary sources — original papers, official documentation, RFCs — not blog posts about papers
- Use Wikipedia-style encyclopedic tone: accurate, neutral, no marketing language
- Include a `## Sources and Further Reading` section with numbered citations
- Link to related wiki articles using relative paths in `related:` frontmatter
- Accuracy over comprehensiveness — a shorter correct article is better than a longer inaccurate one
