Google Cloud Workflows is a fully managed orchestration service that executes workflows defined as a sequence of steps. Each step can call an HTTP endpoint, invoke a Cloud Function or Cloud Run service, access GCP APIs, perform conditional logic, or iterate over data. Workflows manages execution state, handles retries and error handling, and ensures that multi-step processes complete reliably even when individual steps fail temporarily. It is serverless -- there is no infrastructure to manage, and you pay only per step executed.

In AI pipelines, Workflows orchestrates the multi-step processing chains that connect data sources to AI services and outputs. A document processing workflow might: (1) receive a Cloud Storage notification, (2) call Document AI to extract text, (3) call Vertex AI Gemini for classification, (4) write results to Firestore, and (5) send a notification via Pub/Sub. Each step is defined declaratively in YAML or JSON, with built-in support for error handling, retry policies with exponential backoff, conditional branching, parallel execution, and sub-workflows. Workflows supports long-running operations that can pause and resume, with a maximum execution duration of one year.

Workflows differs from Cloud Composer (managed Airflow) in its scope and complexity. Workflows is lightweight and event-driven, ideal for API orchestration and microservice coordination with execution durations from seconds to hours. Cloud Composer is a heavier platform for complex data pipeline DAGs with scheduling, dependency management, and rich operator libraries. For most AI service orchestration patterns -- calling a sequence of APIs with branching and error handling -- Workflows is the simpler and more cost-effective choice. Cloud Composer is better suited for scheduled batch data pipelines with complex dependencies.

## Key Capabilities

- **Declarative YAML/JSON Syntax** - Define workflows as ordered steps with conditions, loops, and error handlers, without writing orchestration code.
- **Built-In GCP Connectors** - Native connectors for 200+ GCP APIs, including Vertex AI, BigQuery, Firestore, and Cloud Storage, with automatic authentication.
- **Parallel Execution** - Execute multiple branches concurrently and aggregate results, enabling parallel AI processing patterns.
- **Long-Running Execution** - Supports workflows that run for up to one year, with built-in callbacks and wait states for human-in-the-loop and async patterns.

## AWS Equivalent

Cloud Workflows is Google Cloud's counterpart to AWS Step Functions. Both services provide serverless workflow orchestration with state management, error handling, and branching logic. Step Functions offers a visual workflow designer and more granular integration patterns (Express vs. Standard workflows), while Workflows uses a YAML-based definition language and provides tighter integration with GCP APIs through built-in connectors. Step Functions has a more mature ecosystem of service integrations within AWS.

## Origins and History

Google Cloud Workflows was announced at Google Cloud Next 2020 and reached general availability in January 2021. The service filled a gap in the GCP ecosystem -- previously, orchestrating multi-step processes required Cloud Composer (overpowered for simple workflows) or custom code. Parallel execution support was added in 2022, enabling fan-out/fan-in patterns. Connectors for Vertex AI, Document AI, and other AI services were progressively added throughout 2022 and 2023. In 2023, Google introduced Workflows callbacks, enabling workflows to pause and wait for external events before resuming.
