Amazon QuickSight is a serverless business intelligence service that provides interactive dashboards, ML-powered insights, and natural language querying. Unlike traditional BI tools that require dedicated server infrastructure, QuickSight is fully managed and scales to thousands of users without capacity planning. For AI projects, QuickSight serves as the presentation layer that makes model outputs, pipeline metrics, and business KPIs accessible to stakeholders who do not interact with technical tools.

## Core Concepts

**Dataset** - A prepared data source ready for visualization. Datasets connect to Athena, Redshift, RDS, S3, and many third-party sources. You can apply transformations (filters, calculated fields, joins) at the dataset level so that dashboard authors work with clean, business-ready data.

**SPICE** - Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine. SPICE is QuickSight's in-memory cache that stores data for fast dashboard rendering. When a dataset uses SPICE, queries run against the in-memory cache rather than the source database, providing sub-second response times and reducing load on source systems. SPICE refreshes on a configurable schedule.

**Analysis** - The authoring environment where you build visualizations. An analysis contains one or more sheets, each with multiple visual elements (charts, tables, KPIs, maps).

**Dashboard** - A published, read-only view of an analysis. Dashboards are what end users interact with. They support filters, drill-downs, and parameter controls but cannot be structurally modified by viewers.

## ML-Powered Insights

QuickSight includes several ML features that require no model building:

**Anomaly detection** - QuickSight automatically identifies anomalies in time series data using ML. Anomalies appear as highlighted points on charts with explanations of which dimensions contributed to the deviation. This runs automatically on any time series visualization without configuration.

**Forecasting** - Built-in forecasting adds projected values to time series charts. QuickSight uses ML to generate point estimates and confidence intervals. Useful for quick directional forecasts, though not a replacement for Amazon Forecast for production forecasting.

**Auto-narratives** - QuickSight generates natural language summaries of chart data. A bar chart showing regional sales automatically produces text like "North region leads with $2.3M, 15% above average." These narratives are useful in email reports and executive dashboards.

## QuickSight Q (Natural Language Queries)

QuickSight Q enables users to ask questions in natural language and receive visualizations as answers. "What were total sales by region last quarter?" returns a bar chart without the user building it manually. Q uses ML to map natural language to dataset columns and appropriate chart types.

Q requires topic configuration: you define which datasets are searchable and provide synonyms for column names (mapping business terminology like "revenue" to column names like "total_amount"). The initial setup takes effort but dramatically reduces the barrier for non-technical users to get answers from data.

## Embedding QuickSight

QuickSight dashboards can be embedded in web applications using the embedding SDK. This is valuable for AI products where model insights need to be presented within a customer-facing application. Embedding supports anonymous access (for public dashboards), registered user access (for authenticated applications), and row-level security (each user sees only their data).

The embedding API generates a signed URL with configurable session duration and permissions. The JavaScript SDK handles iframe creation, event handling, and responsive resizing.

## AI Project Dashboard Patterns

**Model performance dashboard** - Connect to a table of model predictions and actuals. Visualize accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 over time with anomaly detection highlighting degradation. Segment by customer type, region, or model version.

**Pipeline monitoring** - Display job status (success/failure rates), data freshness (time since last update), and data quality scores. Use conditional formatting to highlight issues in red.

**ROI tracking** - Show the business impact of AI implementations: time saved, cost reduced, revenue influenced. Compare pre-deployment and post-deployment metrics with forecast lines showing projected vs actual impact.

## Pricing

QuickSight offers per-user pricing in two tiers: Author (creates dashboards) and Reader (views dashboards). Reader pricing can be per-session (pay only when they log in) or per-month. SPICE storage is charged per GB. For organizations with many casual viewers, the per-session Reader pricing is cost-effective because users who do not log in incur no cost.
