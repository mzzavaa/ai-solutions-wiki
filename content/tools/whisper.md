Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI that approaches human-level robustness and accuracy across a wide range of audio conditions. Trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web, Whisper demonstrates strong generalization to diverse accents, background noise, technical language, and multiple languages without the need for fine-tuning. The model performs transcription in 99 languages and can translate from any of these languages into English.

Whisper uses a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. Audio is converted to a log-Mel spectrogram, processed by the encoder, and decoded autoregressively into text tokens. The model comes in multiple sizes (tiny, base, small, medium, large, turbo) ranging from 39 million to 1.55 billion parameters, allowing users to choose the appropriate trade-off between speed and accuracy for their use case. The large-v3 model achieves word error rates competitive with or better than commercial speech recognition services on standard benchmarks. Whisper can also perform voice activity detection, language identification, and timestamp-level alignment.

Whisper has been widely adopted for podcast transcription, meeting notes, subtitle generation, accessibility tools, and as a speech input component in voice-enabled applications. The open-source release has spawned an ecosystem of optimized implementations including faster-whisper (CTranslate2-based), whisper.cpp (C++ port for CPU and edge devices), and WhisperX (with word-level alignment). These community variants significantly improve inference speed, making real-time transcription feasible on consumer hardware.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multilingual Transcription** - Accurate speech-to-text in 99 languages trained on 680,000 hours of diverse audio data
- **Noise Robustness** - Strong performance on noisy, accented, and technical speech without domain-specific fine-tuning
- **Multiple Model Sizes** - From 39M to 1.55B parameters, enabling deployment from edge devices to GPU servers
- **Translation** - Built-in speech translation from any supported language into English

## Cloud Equivalents

Whisper is the open-source alternative to AWS Transcribe, Azure Speech-to-Text, and Google Cloud Speech-to-Text. Cloud speech services offer real-time streaming transcription, custom vocabulary, and speaker diarization out of the box, while Whisper provides unlimited free transcription, offline processing, and competitive accuracy with no per-minute costs.

## Origins and History

Whisper was developed at OpenAI and released in September 2022 by Alec Radford, Jong Wook Kim, Tao Xu, Greg Brockman, Christine McLeavey, and Ilya Sutskever. The model weights and code are released under the MIT License. Whisper large-v2 followed in December 2022, large-v3 in November 2023, and large-v3-turbo in 2024 with improved speed. The community-driven faster-whisper implementation by SYSTRAN achieved 4x speed improvements using CTranslate2, and Georgi Gerganov's whisper.cpp brought efficient CPU inference.
