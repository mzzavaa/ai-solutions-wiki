Apache Flink is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded (streaming) and bounded (batch) data streams. Unlike systems that treat streaming as an extension of batch processing, Flink was designed from the start as a streaming-first engine, treating batch as a special case of streaming. This architectural choice gives Flink true low-latency event-at-a-time processing with exactly-once state consistency guarantees, making it the leading open-source choice for mission-critical stream processing.

Flink provides multiple layers of abstraction for building streaming applications. The Process Function API offers fine-grained control over time and state, the DataStream API provides common operations like map, filter, and window, and Flink SQL enables stream and batch processing with standard SQL syntax. Flink's state management is a core differentiator: applications can maintain large amounts of state (terabytes) with exactly-once consistency, backed by configurable state backends including RocksDB for large state and heap-based backends for speed. Checkpointing and savepoints enable fault tolerance and application upgrades without data loss.

Flink is widely adopted for real-time analytics, event-driven applications, ETL pipelines, and machine learning feature computation. Companies like Alibaba (which contributed significantly to Flink's development), Netflix, Uber, and Spotify use Flink for processing billions of events per day. The technology also underpins Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics and is available as a managed service through Confluent Cloud and Ververica Platform.

## Key Capabilities

- **Exactly-Once Semantics** - Distributed snapshots and checkpointing provide exactly-once processing guarantees even during failures
- **Stateful Processing** - Manages terabytes of application state with pluggable backends, enabling complex event processing and windowed aggregations
- **Flink SQL** - Full SQL support for both streaming and batch queries, with support for temporal tables and pattern matching (MATCH_RECOGNIZE)
- **Event Time Processing** - First-class support for event time semantics with watermarks, enabling correct results on out-of-order data

## Cloud Equivalents

Apache Flink is the open-source alternative to AWS Kinesis Data Analytics, Azure Stream Analytics, and Google Cloud Dataflow. Managed services simplify operations and auto-scaling, while self-hosted Flink provides full control over cluster configuration, state backend tuning, and deployment topology.

## Origins and History

Apache Flink originated from the Stratosphere research project at TU Berlin, led by Volker Markl, with key contributions from Stephan Ewen, Kostas Tzoumas, and Robert Metzger. The project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation in 2014 and became a top-level project in 2015. Flink is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Tzoumas, Ewen, and others co-founded Data Artisans (later renamed Ververica) in 2014, which was acquired by Alibaba in 2019. Alibaba subsequently made major contributions to Flink, including the Blink query processor that was merged into the main project.
