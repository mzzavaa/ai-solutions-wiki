OpenTelemetry (OTel) is a vendor-neutral, open-source observability framework that provides a single set of APIs, SDKs, and tools for generating, collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data -- traces, metrics, and logs -- from applications and infrastructure. It is the industry standard for instrumenting cloud-native software, supported by virtually every observability vendor, cloud provider, and monitoring platform. OpenTelemetry's goal is to make high-quality telemetry a built-in feature of all software, eliminating vendor lock-in for observability data.

OpenTelemetry provides instrumentation libraries in 11+ languages (Go, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, .NET, Ruby, PHP, Rust, C++, Erlang, Swift) with both manual and automatic instrumentation capabilities. Auto-instrumentation agents can capture traces and metrics from popular frameworks and libraries (HTTP servers, database clients, messaging systems) without code changes. The OpenTelemetry Collector is a vendor-agnostic proxy that receives, processes, and exports telemetry data to multiple backends simultaneously. It supports receivers (OTLP, Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin), processors (batching, filtering, sampling, attribute manipulation), and exporters (Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, OTLP, and vendor-specific backends).

OpenTelemetry is the second most active CNCF project after Kubernetes by contributor count. It was formed in 2019 from the merger of OpenTracing and OpenCensus, unifying two competing instrumentation standards. All major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and observability vendors (Datadog, Splunk, New Relic, Grafana Labs, Dynatrace) support OpenTelemetry as an ingestion format, making it the lingua franca of observability data.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unified Telemetry** - Single framework for traces, metrics, and logs with correlated signals for comprehensive observability
- **Auto-Instrumentation** - Zero-code instrumentation agents for Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, and other languages that capture telemetry automatically
- **OpenTelemetry Collector** - Vendor-agnostic telemetry pipeline for receiving, processing, and exporting data to any supported backend
- **Vendor Neutrality** - Standard APIs and protocols (OTLP) supported by all major observability platforms, preventing vendor lock-in

## Cloud Equivalents

OpenTelemetry is the open-source standard that complements (rather than directly replaces) AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Operations. Cloud monitoring services are backends that consume OTel data, while OpenTelemetry standardizes how telemetry is generated and collected, enabling organizations to switch backends without re-instrumenting applications.

## Origins and History

OpenTelemetry was formed in 2019 through the merger of OpenTracing (created by Ben Sigelman at LightStep, 2016) and OpenCensus (created at Google, 2018). The merger was announced by the CNCF to unify the fragmented instrumentation landscape. OpenTelemetry is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and is a CNCF incubating project. The tracing specification reached GA in 2021, metrics in 2023, and logs stabilization has been ongoing. The project has over 1,000 contributors across its repositories.
