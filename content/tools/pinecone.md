Pinecone is a fully managed vector database designed for similarity search at scale. You store vector embeddings (numerical representations of text, images, or any data), and Pinecone indexes them for fast nearest-neighbor retrieval. For AI projects, Pinecone is primarily used as the retrieval layer in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems: embed your documents, store them in Pinecone, and retrieve relevant context to ground LLM responses.

## Core Concepts

**Index** - The primary resource. An index stores vectors and their associated metadata. Indexes are configured with a fixed vector dimension (must match your embedding model's output dimension) and a similarity metric (cosine, dot product, or Euclidean distance).

**Namespace** - A partition within an index. Namespaces logically separate vectors without creating additional indexes. Common uses: separate vectors by tenant (multi-tenant applications), by document collection, or by environment (staging vs production in a shared index). Queries are scoped to a single namespace.

**Vector** - A record consisting of a unique ID, a vector (array of floats), and optional metadata (key-value pairs like source document, chunk index, category, or date). Metadata enables filtered search: retrieve vectors that are both semantically similar and match metadata conditions.

**Pod-based vs Serverless** - Pinecone offers two architectures. Pod-based indexes run on dedicated infrastructure with configurable pod types and replicas. Serverless indexes scale automatically and charge based on usage. Serverless is the recommended starting point for most projects.

## RAG Integration Pattern

The standard RAG pattern with Pinecone:

1. **Ingest** - Split documents into chunks (typically 200-500 tokens). Embed each chunk using an embedding model (OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, Cohere embed, or similar). Upsert the vectors to Pinecone with metadata containing the source document, chunk text, and any relevant attributes.

2. **Query** - When a user asks a question, embed the query using the same embedding model. Search Pinecone for the top-k most similar vectors. Optionally apply metadata filters (restrict to specific document categories, date ranges, or access levels).

3. **Generate** - Pass the retrieved chunk texts as context to the LLM along with the user's question. The model generates a response grounded in the retrieved content.

## Metadata Filtering

Pinecone supports filtering on metadata fields during search. Filters use a JSON syntax supporting equality, range, and set membership operators. Filters are applied before similarity ranking, which means they can significantly reduce the search space and improve relevance.

Effective metadata design is critical. Include fields that your application will filter on: document_type, department, access_level, date, language. Avoid storing the full chunk text in metadata if it is very large; store it in a separate database and reference it by ID.

## Hybrid Search

Pinecone supports sparse-dense hybrid search, combining keyword-based (sparse) and semantic (dense) vectors in a single query. This addresses the limitation of pure semantic search, which can miss exact keyword matches. Hybrid search uses an alpha parameter to weight between sparse and dense results. This is particularly effective for technical domains where specific terminology matters.

## Performance and Scale

Pinecone is designed for low-latency queries at scale. Serverless indexes handle millions of vectors with query latencies under 100ms for top-10 retrieval. For larger indexes (tens of millions of vectors), query latency depends on the index configuration and filter complexity.

For high-throughput ingestion, use batch upserts (up to 100 vectors per request) and parallelize across multiple connections. The serverless architecture handles ingestion spikes automatically.

## Pricing

Serverless pricing is based on read units (queries), write units (upserts and updates), and storage (GB of vectors and metadata). This usage-based model is cost-effective for variable workloads. Pod-based pricing is per pod-hour, which provides predictable costs for steady-state workloads. Evaluate based on your expected query volume and index size: serverless is typically cheaper for development and moderate production loads, while pods may be cheaper for sustained high-throughput workloads.
