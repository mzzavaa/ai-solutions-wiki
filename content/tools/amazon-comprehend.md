Amazon Comprehend is a managed NLP service that provides trained models for common text analysis tasks without requiring ML expertise or model training. It handles the high-volume, structured NLP tasks that would otherwise require either custom model development or expensive LLM calls.

## What Comprehend Does

**Sentiment analysis** - Classifies text as positive, negative, neutral, or mixed, with a confidence score for each. Works at the document level and at the entity level (targeted sentiment). Useful for customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and product review processing.

**Entity recognition** - Identifies and classifies named entities: people, organizations, locations, dates, quantities, events. Returns the entity text, type, and position in the document. For domain-specific entities (medical terms, legal entities, product names), Comprehend custom entity recognition allows training on your own labeled examples.

**Key phrase extraction** - Identifies the main concepts and topics in text without requiring a predefined taxonomy. Useful for search indexing and quick summarization of large text volumes.

**Topic modeling** - Identifies recurring themes across a document collection using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Batch operation: you provide thousands of documents, Comprehend returns topic clusters and the terms that characterize each topic. Useful for understanding what a large customer feedback corpus is actually about.

**Language detection** - Identifies the language of text with a confidence score. Supports 100 languages. Useful as a preprocessing step before language-specific processing pipelines.

**PII detection and redaction** - Identifies personally identifiable information (names, addresses, credit card numbers, etc.) and can automatically redact it. Useful for compliance workflows where documents must be processed without exposing PII.

## Comprehend vs. Bedrock for NLP Tasks

Both services can perform NLP tasks, but they have different cost and performance profiles:

**Use Comprehend when:**
- Processing high volumes (10,000+ documents per day) - Comprehend is significantly cheaper than Bedrock per document for standard tasks
- You need consistent, structured output - Comprehend returns structured JSON responses with defined schemas
- Latency is critical - Comprehend is faster for synchronous calls
- Tasks are well-defined and standard - sentiment, entities, language, key phrases

**Use Bedrock (Claude) when:**
- The task requires reasoning or judgment beyond classification - "What is the author's attitude toward the policy?" vs. "Positive/Negative?"
- You need nuanced extraction that benefits from context - extracting contract obligations requires understanding, not just pattern matching
- You need explanation with the output - "Why is this review negative?" requires generation
- Volume is low - LLM costs per call are higher but acceptable at modest volumes

For many production NLP pipelines, Comprehend and Bedrock are complementary: Comprehend handles volume preprocessing (language detection, basic entity extraction, sentiment flagging), and Bedrock handles the cases Comprehend flags for deeper analysis.

## Custom Classification and Entity Recognition

Comprehend Custom allows training classification and entity recognition models on your own labeled data. Training a custom classifier requires 100+ labeled examples per class minimum, and performance improves substantially with 1,000+.

This is the right choice when you have domain-specific categories that general models do not know about: product category taxonomies, internal issue classification schemas, or specialized document types. Training cost is low (typically under 100 EUR per training job); inference is priced per unit, cheaper than Bedrock for high-volume classification.
