Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit that has become the de facto standard for metrics collection in cloud-native environments. It features a multi-dimensional data model where time series are identified by metric name and key-value label pairs, a powerful query language called PromQL for slicing and aggregating time series data, and an autonomous architecture where each Prometheus server operates independently without relying on distributed storage or network-dependent components.

Prometheus collects metrics by scraping HTTP endpoints at configured intervals, following a pull-based model that simplifies service discovery and makes monitoring resilient to network partitions. The ecosystem includes client libraries for instrumenting applications in Go, Java, Python, Ruby, and other languages; exporters for third-party systems (Node Exporter for hardware metrics, MySQL Exporter, etc.); Alertmanager for routing, deduplicating, and silencing alerts; and Pushgateway for short-lived batch jobs. Prometheus stores data in an efficient custom time-series database on local disk, with support for remote write and remote read protocols for long-term storage backends like Thanos, Cortex, and Grafana Mimir.

Prometheus is a graduated project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the second project to graduate after Kubernetes. It is ubiquitous in Kubernetes environments, with most Kubernetes distributions and operators exposing Prometheus-format metrics by default. The Prometheus ecosystem's influence extends beyond its own codebase: the Prometheus exposition format has become the industry standard for metrics, adopted by hundreds of systems and applications.

## Key Capabilities

- **PromQL** - Powerful functional query language for real-time aggregation, filtering, and mathematical operations on multi-dimensional time series
- **Pull-Based Collection** - HTTP scraping model with service discovery for Kubernetes, Consul, DNS, EC2, and other platforms
- **Alertmanager** - Alert routing, grouping, deduplication, silencing, and notification via email, Slack, PagerDuty, and webhooks
- **Dimensional Data Model** - Metrics identified by name and arbitrary key-value labels enabling flexible, ad-hoc querying and aggregation

## Cloud Equivalents

Prometheus is the open-source alternative to AWS CloudWatch Metrics, Azure Monitor Metrics, and Google Cloud Monitoring. Cloud monitoring services offer serverless operation and deeper integration with managed services, while Prometheus provides a vendor-neutral metrics standard, PromQL's superior query expressiveness, and zero data egress concerns.

## Origins and History

Prometheus was created by Matt T. Proud and Julius Volz at SoundCloud in 2012, inspired by Google's internal Borgmon monitoring system. It was open-sourced in January 2015 and became the second project to join the CNCF in May 2016, graduating in August 2018. Prometheus is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. The Prometheus exposition format has been standardized as OpenMetrics, further cementing its role as the industry standard for metrics.
