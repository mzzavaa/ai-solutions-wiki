AWS Amplify is a platform for building and deploying full-stack web and mobile applications on AWS. It provides hosting for static and server-side rendered apps, CI/CD pipelines connected to Git repositories, and a library for connecting front-end code to AWS services. For AI application front-ends, Amplify is the fastest path from a React or Next.js codebase to a deployed, scalable application.

Official documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/

**Azure equivalent:** Azure Static Web Apps. **GCP equivalent:** Firebase Hosting.

## Amplify Hosting

Amplify Hosting deploys front-end applications from GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or CodeCommit. Connect a repository, configure build settings (npm run build, output directory), and Amplify provisions:
- CDN distribution (CloudFront)
- SSL certificate (ACM)
- Custom domain configuration
- Branch-based preview environments (every PR gets a unique URL)

For Hugo sites like this wiki, Amplify Hosting with a `hugo` build command is a clean alternative to GitHub Pages.

## Front-End to AWS AI Integration

The Amplify JavaScript library (`@aws-amplify/core`, `@aws-amplify/auth`) simplifies connecting React/Next.js apps to AWS services:

**Authentication via Cognito:** Configure Cognito User Pool in `amplify/auth`, and the Amplify library handles sign-up, sign-in, MFA, and token refresh. Pre-built UI components (Authenticator) provide a working auth flow with minimal code.

**API calls to Lambda/API Gateway:** Amplify generates typed API clients from your backend definition, so front-end calls to AI endpoints are type-safe and automatically include authentication headers.

**Storage integration:** Amplify Storage wraps S3 with user-scoped paths and presigned URL generation, so users can upload files (images, audio, documents) for AI processing without backend code to manage permissions.

## Amplify Gen 2

Gen 2 (released 2024) uses TypeScript for backend definitions instead of the older JSON-based CLI workflow. Define auth, data, storage, and functions in TypeScript files, and Amplify synthesizes CloudFormation stacks. This code-first approach integrates better with version control and makes backend configuration reviewable in pull requests.

## When to Use Amplify

Amplify is a good fit when:
- The front-end team is JavaScript/TypeScript-native and wants to avoid deep AWS configuration
- You need branch previews for rapid iteration
- The backend is primarily AWS-managed services (Cognito, AppSync, Lambda)

Amplify adds an abstraction layer over CloudFormation. For teams that need precise control over infrastructure, Terraform or CDK may be more appropriate.
