AWS Step Functions is a serverless workflow orchestration service that coordinates sequences of AWS service calls, Lambda functions, and external APIs. For AI pipelines - which typically involve multiple stages (ingest, process, model call, store results) - Step Functions provides the glue layer that handles sequencing, error handling, retries, and parallel execution.

## Why Step Functions for AI Pipelines

AI pipelines have characteristics that make orchestration critical:

- **Long-running processes** - Document processing, model training, and batch inference can run for seconds to hours. Step Functions maintains state across these durations without keeping a Lambda function alive.
- **Multi-step dependencies** - Step 3 cannot start until Steps 1 and 2 complete. Step Functions expresses these dependencies declaratively.
- **Error handling complexity** - If the Textract call succeeds but the Bedrock call fails, do you retry Bedrock, restart from Textract, or route to a human review queue? Step Functions makes these branching decisions explicit and auditable.
- **Parallel execution** - Processing 1000 documents simultaneously requires fan-out and fan-in logic. Step Functions Map state handles this natively.

## Core Concepts

**State machine** - The workflow definition, written in Amazon States Language (JSON/YAML). Defines states (tasks, choices, parallel branches, wait, succeed, fail) and transitions between them.

**Task state** - Invokes an AWS service or Lambda function and waits for the result. Step Functions integrates natively with over 200 AWS services - you can call Bedrock, Textract, SQS, DynamoDB, and more without Lambda wrappers.

**Choice state** - Branches the workflow based on data from previous states. Used for routing logic: "if document type is invoice, go to invoice_processing; else go to general_processing."

**Map state** - Executes a sub-workflow for each item in an array, concurrently or with a concurrency limit. Essential for batch processing patterns.

**Wait state** - Pauses the workflow until a callback token is returned (used for human approval steps) or a timestamp is reached.

## AI Pipeline Pattern

A typical document processing pipeline in Step Functions:

1. **Validate** - Lambda checks that the S3 object is a valid document type and size
2. **Extract** (parallel) - Textract extracts text; a metadata step reads S3 object tags
3. **Enrich** - Bedrock LLM call classifies and structures the extracted content
4. **Store** - DynamoDB write for the structured result; S3 write for the enriched document
5. **Notify** - SNS message to downstream consumers

Each step includes retry configuration (exponential backoff for API rate limit errors) and error handling (route failures to a dead-letter SQS queue with full execution context for debugging).

## Express vs Standard Workflows

**Standard Workflows** - For long-running, auditable processes. State transitions are logged and can be reviewed in the console. Maximum duration 1 year. Priced per state transition. Use for document processing, claims workflows, and any process that needs audit trails.

**Express Workflows** - For high-throughput, short-duration processes. Up to 100,000 executions per second. Maximum duration 5 minutes. Priced per duration. Use for real-time API orchestration and event processing.

## Integration with Bedrock

Step Functions has native Bedrock integration via the `aws-sdk:bedrock-runtime:invokeModel` integration. This means you can call Bedrock models directly from a Step Functions task state without a Lambda wrapper, reducing latency and simplifying the pipeline definition.

For Bedrock Agents, the pattern is: trigger agent execution via Step Functions, poll for completion, then branch on the agent's response.
