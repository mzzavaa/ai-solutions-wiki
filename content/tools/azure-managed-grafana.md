Azure Managed Grafana is a fully managed service that runs Grafana, the popular open-source data visualization and monitoring platform, on Azure infrastructure. It provides the full Grafana dashboarding experience -- interactive panels, alerting, annotations, and team collaboration features -- without the operational burden of managing Grafana servers, upgrades, plugins, and high availability configuration. For AI operations teams, Managed Grafana serves as the visualization layer for monitoring ML model performance, tracking inference endpoint latency and throughput, observing data pipeline health, and creating executive dashboards that combine AI metrics with business KPIs.

The service comes with pre-configured data source plugins for Azure Monitor (metrics and logs), Azure Data Explorer, Azure Managed Prometheus, and Microsoft Entra ID. This native integration means teams can query Azure Monitor metrics and KQL-based log data directly from Grafana dashboards without configuring credentials or network connectivity. Additional data source plugins support Prometheus, InfluxDB, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and dozens of other data sources, enabling unified dashboards that combine Azure-native telemetry with data from external systems. Grafana alerting rules can trigger notifications through email, Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, and other channels when metrics cross thresholds.

Azure Managed Grafana supports the Essential and Standard pricing tiers. The Essential tier provides core dashboarding with Azure data sources at lower cost. The Standard tier adds Grafana Enterprise plugins, enhanced availability (zone redundancy), more dashboards, and higher query rates. The service integrates with Azure Active Directory for authentication and role-based access control, mapping Azure AD groups to Grafana roles (Viewer, Editor, Admin). API key and service principal access enables programmatic dashboard management and CI/CD-driven dashboard deployment from infrastructure-as-code repositories.

## Key Capabilities

- **Native Azure Integration** - Pre-configured data source plugins for Azure Monitor, Azure Data Explorer, and Managed Prometheus with automatic authentication
- **Full Grafana Experience** - Complete Grafana dashboard authoring, alerting, annotations, variables, and templating without managing Grafana infrastructure
- **Azure AD Authentication** - Integrated identity management with Azure AD/Entra ID, mapping AD groups to Grafana roles for seamless access control
- **Deterministic Pricing** - Instance-based pricing without per-user charges enables cost-predictable deployment for teams of any size

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Managed Grafana is Azure's counterpart to Amazon Managed Grafana. Both provide fully managed Grafana instances with native cloud data source integration. The services are functionally similar, with Azure Managed Grafana offering deeper Azure Monitor and Azure Data Explorer integration, while Amazon Managed Grafana integrates more tightly with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and AWS SSO. Both benefit from Grafana Labs' enterprise partnership for plugin support.

## Origins and History

Azure Managed Grafana was announced at Ignite 2021 in November 2021 and reached general availability on August 17, 2022. The service was developed in partnership with Grafana Labs, which also partnered with AWS for Amazon Managed Grafana. The Essential pricing tier was introduced in 2023, providing a lower-cost option for teams that do not need enterprise plugins or zone redundancy. Managed Prometheus integration, complementing Managed Grafana for Kubernetes monitoring, reached GA in May 2023. Grafana version upgrades (from Grafana 9 to 10) have been managed automatically by the service.
