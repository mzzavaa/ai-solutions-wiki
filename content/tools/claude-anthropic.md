Claude is Anthropic's family of large language models, designed with a focus on safety, reliability, and extended context handling. For enterprise AI applications, Claude is one of the most widely deployed models via Amazon Bedrock, where it is available across multiple capability tiers.

## Model Tiers

Anthropic releases Claude in three tiers optimized for different cost/performance trade-offs:

**Haiku** - The fastest and most cost-efficient tier. Latency under 1 second for most requests. Best for high-volume, lower-complexity tasks: classification, short-form extraction, simple summarization, intent detection. At roughly 10-15x cheaper than Sonnet per token, Haiku is the right default for any pipeline where tasks are well-defined and the model's reasoning power is not the bottleneck.

**Sonnet** - The middle tier, balancing capability and cost. Strong performance on document analysis, multi-step reasoning, code generation, and complex summarization. For most enterprise knowledge worker tasks (document review, draft generation, data analysis), Sonnet provides the best practical value.

**Opus** - The highest-capability tier for complex reasoning tasks. Use where accuracy on difficult, nuanced tasks justifies the cost premium: complex legal analysis, advanced code review, multi-document synthesis, research tasks with ambiguous source material.

## Key Strengths

**Long context window** - Claude supports context windows up to 200,000 tokens (approximately 150,000 words). This means entire books, large codebases, or extensive document sets can be processed in a single call without chunking. For RAG pipelines where traditional chunking limits retrieval quality, Claude's long context can process entire source documents directly.

**Instruction following** - Claude reliably follows complex, structured instructions, including multi-part JSON output schemas, tone and style constraints, and conditional logic instructions. This makes it well-suited for applications with strict output format requirements.

**Reduced hallucination on constrained tasks** - When instructed to answer only from provided context and to acknowledge when information is not present, Claude follows these constraints reliably. This is critical for enterprise knowledge base applications where accurate sourcing matters.

**Code tasks** - Claude performs well on code generation, debugging, and documentation tasks, including less common languages and frameworks. Code quality and correctness are competitive with specialized coding models for most enterprise use cases.

## Access Options

Claude is available through:
- **Anthropic API** - Direct API access with usage-based pricing
- **Amazon Bedrock** - Access via Bedrock API with AWS IAM, VPC, and compliance controls; data stays within your AWS account
- **Claude.ai** - Web and API interface for direct use and team collaboration features

For enterprise deployments requiring data residency controls, compliance certifications (SOC 2, HIPAA BAA), and IAM integration, Bedrock is typically the preferred access path.

## Common Enterprise Use Cases

- **Document processing** - Contract review, policy analysis, report summarization
- **Customer service** - Intelligent response drafting, inquiry triage, escalation detection
- **Code assistance** - Review, generation, refactoring, documentation
- **Knowledge management** - Q&A over internal documentation, knowledge base search and synthesis
- **Data analysis** - Interpreting structured data outputs, generating narrative from metrics, analyzing reports

## Pricing via Bedrock

Bedrock pricing for Claude is per-token (input and output separately). Haiku is significantly cheaper than Sonnet, which is cheaper than Opus. Pricing changes over time - always check the current Bedrock pricing page before building cost models for production workloads.
