Supabase is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform that provides developers with a suite of tools for building modern applications without managing backend infrastructure. Often described as an open-source alternative to Firebase, Supabase differentiates itself by building on PostgreSQL rather than a proprietary NoSQL database, giving developers the full power of relational SQL, ACID transactions, and the PostgreSQL extension ecosystem (including PostGIS for geospatial, pgvector for AI embeddings, and pg_cron for scheduling).

Supabase bundles several open-source components into a cohesive platform: a PostgreSQL database with an auto-generated REST API (via PostgREST) and GraphQL API (via pg_graphql), GoTrue for authentication supporting email/password, OAuth providers, magic links, and phone auth, Realtime for WebSocket-based change data capture and broadcast, Supabase Storage for file management built on S3-compatible object storage, and Edge Functions (Deno-based serverless functions). Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in PostgreSQL serve as the authorization layer, ensuring data access rules are enforced at the database level regardless of how data is accessed. The Supabase Dashboard provides a table editor, SQL editor, and management UI.

Supabase has gained rapid adoption among developers building web and mobile applications, SaaS products, and AI applications (leveraging pgvector for vector search). Its developer experience, generous free tier on Supabase Cloud, and PostgreSQL foundation have made it particularly popular in the startup ecosystem. Companies and projects of all sizes use Supabase, from indie developers to enterprises.

## Key Capabilities

- **PostgreSQL Database** - Full PostgreSQL with auto-generated REST and GraphQL APIs, row-level security, and extension support
- **Authentication** - Built-in auth (GoTrue) supporting email, OAuth, magic links, phone OTP, and SAML with JWT-based sessions
- **Real-Time Subscriptions** - WebSocket-based real-time streaming of database changes, presence, and broadcast messaging
- **Storage and Edge Functions** - S3-compatible file storage with image transformations, and Deno-based serverless functions at the edge

## Cloud Equivalents

Supabase is the open-source alternative to Firebase (Google), AWS Amplify + Cognito, and Azure Mobile Apps. Firebase offers a more mature real-time database and client SDK ecosystem, while Supabase provides the power of PostgreSQL, SQL querying, and the ability to self-host the entire stack with no vendor lock-in.

## Origins and History

Supabase was founded in January 2020 by Paul Copplestone and Ant Wilson. The project launched publicly after participating in Y Combinator (S20). Supabase's core components are licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and MIT License. The company has raised over $116 million in venture funding. Supabase reached general availability in April 2024. Rather than building a monolithic platform, Supabase integrates existing open-source tools (PostgREST, GoTrue, Realtime) and contributes back to those projects.
