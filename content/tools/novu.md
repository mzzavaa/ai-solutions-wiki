Novu is an open-source notification infrastructure platform that provides a unified API for managing transactional notifications across multiple communication channels. It enables developers to send notifications via email, SMS, push notifications, in-app messages, and chat platforms (Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams) through a single API, abstracting away the complexity of integrating with multiple delivery providers and managing notification preferences, templates, and delivery logic.

Novu's architecture centers on a workflow engine that defines notification flows as sequences of steps across channels. Each workflow can include content templates with variable substitution, channel-specific formatting, delay and digest steps (batching multiple notifications into summaries), conditional logic for routing, and subscriber preference management that respects user opt-out choices. The platform supports multiple providers per channel (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, and Amazon SES for email; Twilio and Vonage for SMS) with automatic failover. The notification center component provides an embeddable in-app notification inbox (available as React, Vue, Angular, and Web Component widgets) with real-time updates, read/unread tracking, and action buttons.

Novu is used by development teams building SaaS applications, marketplaces, and platforms that need reliable multi-channel notification delivery. Its open-source, API-first approach appeals to engineering teams that want full control over their notification infrastructure without building it from scratch. Novu Cloud offers a managed hosted version with additional features and higher throughput limits.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Channel Delivery** - Unified API for email, SMS, push, in-app, and chat notifications with provider abstraction and failover
- **Notification Center** - Embeddable in-app notification inbox component (React, Vue, Angular, Web Component) with real-time updates
- **Workflow Engine** - Visual and code-based notification workflows with delays, digests, conditional routing, and channel prioritization
- **Subscriber Preferences** - Built-in preference management allowing end users to control which channels and notification types they receive

## Cloud Equivalents

Novu is the open-source alternative to AWS Pinpoint, Azure Notification Hubs, and Firebase Cloud Messaging. Cloud notification services offer higher scalability for campaign-style messaging, while Novu provides a developer-centric, multi-channel approach focused on transactional notifications with full control over templates, preferences, and delivery logic.

## Origins and History

Novu was founded in 2021 by Dima Grossman and Tomer Barnea. The project was initially called Notifire before being renamed to Novu. It is licensed under the MIT License. Novu participated in Y Combinator and has raised venture funding to support development. The project has accumulated over 30,000 GitHub stars, making it one of the most popular open-source notification frameworks. Novu 1.0, released in 2024, introduced the Framework SDK for defining notification workflows as code.
