Azure Personalizer is an Azure AI service that uses reinforcement learning to select the best content, product, layout, or action to present to an individual user in real time. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely on collaborative filtering or content-based approaches, Personalizer uses contextual bandit algorithms that continuously learn from user interactions to optimize content selection. The service takes in a set of actions (content options), context features (user attributes, device, time, location), and action features (content metadata), then returns a ranked list of actions. When the application reports a reward signal (click, purchase, time spent), Personalizer updates its model to improve future decisions.

The core workflow involves two API calls. The Rank API accepts actions with their features and context features, then returns the recommended action. The Reward API accepts a score between 0 and 1 indicating how well the recommended action performed. This reward loop enables the model to learn continuously from real interactions without explicit training data or offline model building. The exploration rate (configurable between 0% and 100%) controls the balance between exploiting known-good actions and exploring alternatives that might yield better outcomes. Personalizer handles the cold-start problem automatically by exploring broadly when it lacks data about a user or context.

Personalizer is particularly effective for scenarios where content selection needs to adapt to individual preferences in real time: selecting which news articles, products, or promotions to highlight, ordering search results, choosing notification content, personalizing tutorial flows, or adapting chatbot responses. The service is stateless with respect to user identity -- it does not store user profiles but learns patterns across all interactions through the features provided in each request. This makes it suitable for anonymous user personalization and simplifies data privacy compliance.

## Key Capabilities

- **Contextual Bandit Learning** - Reinforcement learning model that optimizes content selection based on real-time context and continuous reward feedback
- **Automatic Exploration** - Configurable exploration rate balances between exploiting proven choices and discovering potentially better alternatives
- **Multi-Slot Personalization** - Rank multiple content slots simultaneously (e.g., hero banner, sidebar, footer) with position-aware optimization
- **Apprentice Mode** - Learns from existing business logic before taking control, enabling safe rollout alongside existing recommendation systems

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Personalizer is Azure's counterpart to Amazon Personalize. Both provide managed recommendation and personalization services, but they use fundamentally different approaches. Personalizer uses online reinforcement learning (contextual bandits) that learns continuously from each interaction without batch training, while Amazon Personalize uses traditional collaborative filtering and deep learning models trained on historical interaction datasets. Personalizer is simpler to set up (two API calls), while Personalize offers more recipe variety and handles larger item catalogs.

## Origins and History

Azure Personalizer originated from Microsoft Research's contextual bandit research, particularly the Vowpal Wabbit library developed by John Langford's team. The service was announced at Build 2019 in May 2019 and reached general availability on November 4, 2019. Multi-slot personalization, enabling optimization across multiple content positions simultaneously, was added in 2021. Apprentice mode, which learns from existing business logic, was introduced to lower the barrier to adoption. Microsoft announced in September 2023 that Personalizer would be retired as a standalone service in October 2025, with personalization capabilities being integrated into other Azure AI platform services.
