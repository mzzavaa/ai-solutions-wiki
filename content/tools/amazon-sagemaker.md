Amazon SageMaker is AWS's managed platform for training, deploying, and monitoring custom machine learning models. It sits at the other end of the spectrum from Bedrock: Bedrock gives you access to pre-built foundation models through an API; SageMaker gives you the infrastructure to train your own models or fine-tune existing ones.

## When to Use SageMaker

SageMaker is the right choice when:
- You need to train a custom model on your own data (classification, regression, object detection, time series forecasting)
- You need to fine-tune a foundation model on domain-specific data for specialized tasks
- You are working with tabular or structured data where traditional ML models (XGBoost, LightGBM) outperform LLMs
- Your inference requirements include latency or cost constraints that foundation model APIs cannot meet
- You need full control over model architecture, training process, and artifact management

SageMaker is not the right choice when your primary use case is prompting a foundation model - use Bedrock for that. The operational overhead of SageMaker is significant; it pays off only when you actually need custom training.

## Key Capabilities

**Training** - SageMaker manages compute provisioning for training jobs. You provide a training script and a dataset location in S3; SageMaker provisions instances, mounts data, runs the job, and saves the model artifact. Managed Spot Training uses EC2 spot instances for up to 90% cost reduction on interruptible training jobs.

**SageMaker JumpStart** - A model hub with pre-trained models and one-click fine-tuning workflows for common foundation models (Llama, Mistral, Falcon). This is the fastest path from raw model to fine-tuned deployment if your use case fits a supported model.

**SageMaker Pipelines** - Automated ML workflows that chain data processing, training, evaluation, and deployment steps. Pipelines are version-controlled and support conditional logic (e.g., only deploy if evaluation metrics exceed a threshold).

**Real-time and batch inference** - Real-time endpoints scale automatically and support A/B testing between model versions. Batch Transform runs inference over large datasets in S3 without a persistent endpoint.

**Model Monitor** - Detects data drift and model quality degradation in production. Configurable checks compare live inference data distributions against training data baselines and alert when drift exceeds thresholds.

## Pricing Model

SageMaker costs have several components:
- Training: per-hour rate for the instance type used during training
- Inference: per-hour for real-time endpoints, per-record for batch transform
- Storage: S3 for data and model artifacts, EFS for shared storage during training
- Feature Store: per-record for writes, per-hour for online store

For most teams, inference endpoint costs dominate total SageMaker spend. Right-sizing instances (using ml.g4dn.xlarge instead of ml.p3.2xlarge where inference latency allows) and enabling auto-scaling down to zero instances during low-traffic periods significantly reduce costs.

## Getting Started

The SageMaker console provides Jupyter-based notebook environments (SageMaker Studio) for development. For new projects, start in Studio with a managed notebook - it handles IAM, VPC, and S3 access configuration automatically. Move to Pipelines when you need reproducibility and automation.

The SageMaker Python SDK provides higher-level abstractions over the raw APIs. Using the SDK's Estimator and Model classes rather than raw API calls reduces boilerplate and handles common configuration patterns.
