AutoGen is an open-source framework from Microsoft Research for building multi-agent systems where multiple AI agents converse with each other to solve tasks. Each agent has a defined role, system prompt, and capabilities (LLM reasoning, code execution, tool use, or human input). Agents exchange messages in a conversation loop, collaborating to complete complex tasks that would be difficult for a single agent. For enterprise AI projects, AutoGen is relevant for workflows that benefit from decomposition into specialized roles: coding tasks with review, research with fact-checking, or planning with validation.

## Core Concepts

**Agent** - A participant in a conversation. AutoGen provides several agent types: AssistantAgent (LLM-powered, generates responses and code), UserProxyAgent (represents the human, can auto-execute code and provide human feedback), and custom agents you define.

**Conversation** - A message exchange between two or more agents. Conversations follow configurable patterns: two-agent chat (back and forth between two agents), group chat (multiple agents with a manager that routes messages), and sequential chat (a chain of agent pairs handling subtasks in order).

**Code execution** - A built-in capability where generated code is executed in a sandboxed environment. The AssistantAgent writes code, the UserProxyAgent executes it, and the result is returned to the AssistantAgent for analysis. This enables data analysis, API integration, and automation tasks with iterative debugging.

**Human-in-the-loop** - The UserProxyAgent can be configured to require human approval before executing code or to allow human input at any point in the conversation. This is critical for enterprise use cases where automated actions must be reviewed.

## Multi-Agent Patterns

**Two-agent coding** - An AssistantAgent writes code, a UserProxyAgent executes it and returns results. If the code fails, the AssistantAgent debugs and retries. This pattern handles data analysis, report generation, and API automation effectively.

**Group chat with roles** - Multiple agents with specialized roles collaborate through a group chat. For example: a Researcher agent gathers information, an Analyst agent interprets data, a Writer agent drafts content, and a Critic agent reviews output. A GroupChatManager routes messages to the appropriate agent based on the conversation state.

**Sequential workflow** - A chain of agent pairs handles subtasks in order. Task 1 output feeds into Task 2, which feeds into Task 3. Each subtask can involve multi-turn conversation between its agents. This maps well to business processes with defined stages.

**Nested conversations** - An agent can trigger a sub-conversation with other agents to handle a complex subtask, returning the result to the main conversation. This enables hierarchical task decomposition.

## AutoGen Studio

AutoGen Studio is a visual interface for building, testing, and debugging multi-agent workflows without writing code. You define agents, configure their capabilities, design conversation flows, and test them interactively. Studio generates the underlying Python code, which can be exported for production deployment.

For enterprise teams, Studio accelerates prototyping by letting business analysts and domain experts design agent workflows without Python expertise.

## Enterprise Considerations

**Cost management** - Multi-agent conversations generate significantly more LLM API calls than single-agent approaches. Each agent response is a separate API call, and conversations can run for many turns. Monitor token usage and set maximum turn limits to prevent runaway costs.

**Determinism** - Multi-agent conversations are inherently non-deterministic. The same input can produce different conversation paths and outputs. For production use cases, add validation steps, output parsers, and fallback logic to handle variability.

**Security** - Code execution must be sandboxed. AutoGen supports Docker-based execution environments. Never run agent-generated code with access to production systems or sensitive data without review.

## When to Use AutoGen

AutoGen is best suited for tasks that naturally decompose into multiple roles, where iterative refinement through conversation improves output quality, and where code execution is a core capability. It is less appropriate for simple single-step tasks (use a direct LLM call), latency-sensitive applications (multi-turn conversations add latency), or production systems requiring deterministic outputs.

## Pricing

AutoGen is open-source (Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 for code, MIT for the framework). Costs are determined by the LLM APIs used and the infrastructure for code execution. Multi-agent patterns consume 3-10x more tokens than single-agent approaches for the same task.
