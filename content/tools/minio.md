MinIO is a high-performance, S3-compatible object storage system built for cloud-native and on-premises environments. It provides a complete implementation of the Amazon S3 API, making it a drop-in replacement for S3 in private cloud, edge computing, and hybrid architectures. MinIO is designed from the ground up for performance, achieving read/write speeds that rival or exceed many commercial object storage solutions, with benchmarks regularly exceeding 300 GB/s on commodity hardware.

MinIO supports enterprise features including erasure coding for data protection, bitrot healing, encryption at rest and in transit, identity management via OpenID Connect and LDAP, bucket replication, object locking for compliance (WORM), and lifecycle management. Its Kubernetes-native operator makes deployment on container orchestration platforms straightforward, and it integrates with standard S3 SDKs, CLI tools, and ecosystem libraries without modification.

The project has found widespread adoption in AI/ML pipelines as a storage backend for training data and model artifacts, in data lake architectures replacing HDFS, and as a foundation for self-hosted cloud storage. Organizations such as Nutanix, VMware, and numerous research institutions rely on MinIO for petabyte-scale storage. Its lightweight single-binary deployment model allows it to run everywhere from Raspberry Pi devices to large distributed clusters.

## Key Capabilities

- **S3 API Compatibility** - Full implementation of the S3 API, enabling use of existing S3 SDKs, tools, and applications without code changes
- **High Performance** - Optimized for throughput with parallel, streaming I/O achieving hundreds of GB/s on modern hardware
- **Erasure Coding** - Built-in data protection that tolerates multiple drive or node failures without data loss
- **Kubernetes Native** - First-class Kubernetes operator for automated deployment, scaling, and management in containerized environments

## Cloud Equivalents

MinIO is the open-source alternative to AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, and Google Cloud Storage. The key tradeoff is that MinIO requires self-managed infrastructure and capacity planning, but offers complete data sovereignty and eliminates egress fees.

## Origins and History

MinIO was founded in 2014 by Anand Babu Periasamy (AB Periasamy), Harshavardhana, and Garima Kapoor. The project was initially released under the Apache License 2.0 and later transitioned to the GNU AGPLv3 license in 2021. MinIO Inc., headquartered in Palo Alto, California, provides commercial support and an enterprise license. The project has accumulated over 45,000 GitHub stars and is one of the most widely deployed open-source object storage systems globally.
