Databricks is a unified analytics platform founded by the creators of Apache Spark, Delta Lake, and MLflow. It provides a collaborative environment for data engineering, data science, and machine learning built on a lakehouse architecture that combines the reliability and governance of data warehouses with the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of data lakes. Databricks runs on all three major clouds (AWS, Azure, and GCP) and manages the underlying Spark infrastructure, allowing teams to focus on data work rather than cluster operations.

## Key Capabilities

- **Lakehouse Architecture** - Delta Lake provides ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel on top of cloud object storage (S3, ADLS, GCS), unifying batch and streaming data into a single source of truth
- **Collaborative Notebooks** - Multi-language notebooks (Python, SQL, Scala, R) with real-time collaboration, version control, and integrated visualization for interactive data exploration and model development
- **Unity Catalog** - Centralized governance layer for data and AI assets including tables, files, models, and feature stores with fine-grained access control and lineage tracking across workspaces
- **MLflow Integration** - Native integration with MLflow for experiment tracking, model registry, model serving, and end-to-end ML lifecycle management

## AWS/Cloud Equivalent

Databricks is a third-party platform that runs on AWS, Azure, and GCP. On AWS, Amazon EMR provides managed Spark clusters at lower cost but without the integrated notebook experience, Delta Lake governance, or ML lifecycle tooling. Azure Synapse Analytics combines Spark with SQL analytics in a Microsoft-native offering. Google Cloud Dataproc provides managed Spark/Hadoop clusters. Databricks differentiates through its unified platform experience, Delta Lake ecosystem, and the depth of its ML and AI tooling including model serving and feature engineering.

## Origins and History

Databricks was founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark at UC Berkeley's AMPLab, including Ali Ghodsi, Matei Zaharia, Ion Stoica, and others. The company launched its cloud platform in 2015. Delta Lake was open-sourced in 2019, establishing the lakehouse paradigm that combined data lake storage with warehouse-grade reliability. Databricks acquired Mosaic ML in 2023 for large language model training capabilities. The company introduced Unity Catalog for cross-workspace governance and expanded into AI-native features including vector search, model serving endpoints, and Databricks Assistant (an AI coding helper). By 2025, Databricks had grown to a valuation exceeding $40 billion and was widely adopted across enterprises for both data engineering and AI/ML workloads.
