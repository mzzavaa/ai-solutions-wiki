Google Cloud Composer is a fully managed Apache Airflow service for authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Airflow is the industry-standard open-source platform for programmatically defining data pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in Python. Cloud Composer handles the infrastructure -- web server, scheduler, workers, metadata database, and Redis queue -- while users focus on writing DAG definitions that describe their pipeline logic.

Cloud Composer is the heavyweight orchestration option on GCP, suited for complex data engineering and MLOps pipelines with many interdependent tasks, scheduled executions, and rich operator libraries. A typical ML pipeline in Composer might: extract data from Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage, transform it with Dataflow or Dataproc, train a model on Vertex AI, evaluate model performance, and conditionally deploy the model to a prediction endpoint -- all defined as a single DAG with dependency management, retries, and SLA monitoring. Composer provides pre-built operators for BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Vertex AI, GKE, Cloud Storage, and dozens of other GCP services, plus the full Airflow operator ecosystem for external systems.

Cloud Composer 2, the current generation, runs on GKE Autopilot and introduces significant improvements over Composer 1: autoscaling workers that scale to zero between DAG runs, faster environment creation (minutes instead of 30+ minutes), smaller minimum environment footprint (reducing cost for light workloads), and improved DAG parsing performance. Composer 2 environments can be configured with private IP for network isolation, CMEK for encryption, and VPC Service Controls for security perimeter enforcement. For teams choosing between Composer and Cloud Workflows, the rule of thumb is: use Workflows for lightweight API orchestration (minutes of execution, simple branching), and Composer for complex scheduled pipelines with many tasks and dependencies (data engineering, ML training, ETL).

## Key Capabilities

- **Full Apache Airflow** - Complete Airflow functionality including DAGs, operators, sensors, hooks, pools, connections, variables, and the Airflow web UI for monitoring and debugging.
- **GCP-Native Operators** - Pre-built operators for BigQuery, Dataflow, Dataproc, Vertex AI, GKE, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, and other GCP services.
- **Autoscaling Workers** - Composer 2 scales workers up and down based on task queue depth, including scaling to zero when no tasks are running, reducing idle costs.
- **Environment Snapshots** - Save and restore environment state including DAGs, plugins, data, and Airflow configuration for disaster recovery and environment cloning.

## AWS Equivalent

Cloud Composer is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA). Both are fully managed Airflow services that handle infrastructure while users write DAGs. MWAA integrates with AWS services through Airflow's AWS operators, while Composer provides GCP-native operators. Composer 2's autoscaling to zero and GKE Autopilot foundation provide more granular cost optimization than MWAA's fixed environment sizing. Both support Airflow 2.x with the latest features.

## Origins and History

Google Cloud Composer was announced at Google Cloud Next 2017 and reached general availability in July 2018, making it one of the first major cloud-managed Airflow services. Cloud Composer 2, built on GKE Autopilot with autoscaling and improved performance, reached general availability in April 2022. Composer 2 addressed the main criticisms of Composer 1: slow environment creation, high minimum cost, and limited scalability. In 2023, Google added support for Airflow 2.6+ features including data-aware scheduling (dataset triggers) and improved task execution performance. Cloud Composer has become the standard orchestration layer for GCP data engineering teams, with Workflows serving the lighter-weight orchestration use cases.
