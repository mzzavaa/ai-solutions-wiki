Google Cloud Dataproc is a fully managed service for running Apache Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Hive, Pig, and Presto workloads. It provisions clusters in 90 seconds or less, integrates natively with other GCP services, and supports per-second billing, making it cost-effective for ephemeral workloads that spin up, process data, and shut down. Dataproc handles cluster lifecycle management, patching, and configuration while providing full access to the underlying open-source ecosystem.

In AI and ML workflows, Dataproc is commonly used for large-scale data preparation, feature engineering, and distributed model training with Spark MLlib or PySpark. Teams migrating existing Hadoop or Spark workloads to the cloud can lift and shift their jobs to Dataproc with minimal code changes. Dataproc integrates with Cloud Storage as the default file system (replacing HDFS), BigQuery for reading and writing analytical data, and Vertex AI for downstream model training and deployment. The Cloud Storage connector allows Spark jobs to read from and write to GCS buckets as if they were local storage, enabling data persistence beyond cluster lifetime.

Dataproc offers three deployment modes. Dataproc on Compute Engine is the traditional model with dedicated VMs. Dataproc on GKE runs Spark workloads on Google Kubernetes Engine, providing resource sharing with other containerized workloads and fine-grained autoscaling. Dataproc Serverless eliminates cluster management entirely -- you submit a Spark batch job or run a Spark interactive session via Jupyter notebooks, and Dataproc provisions and scales the infrastructure automatically. Serverless mode is ideal for ad hoc analytics and exploratory data science where teams want Spark's processing power without managing clusters.

## Key Capabilities

- **Sub-2-Minute Cluster Provisioning** - Clusters start in 90 seconds, enabling an ephemeral compute pattern where clusters are created per job and deleted after completion.
- **Dataproc Serverless** - Submit Spark batch jobs and interactive sessions without managing clusters, with automatic provisioning and autoscaling.
- **Multi-Framework Support** - Run Spark, Hadoop, Flink, Hive, Pig, and Presto on the same platform with pre-installed components and optional component management.
- **Preemptible/Spot VM Support** - Use Spot VMs for worker nodes to reduce costs by up to 80% for fault-tolerant workloads.

## AWS Equivalent

Cloud Dataproc is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon EMR (Elastic MapReduce). Both services provide managed Spark and Hadoop clusters with pay-per-use pricing. Dataproc's cluster launch time (90 seconds) is faster than EMR's typical startup. Dataproc Serverless competes with EMR Serverless, both eliminating cluster management. EMR has a larger ecosystem of supported applications and tighter integration with the broader AWS analytics stack, while Dataproc benefits from native BigQuery and Cloud Storage integration.

## Origins and History

Google Cloud Dataproc was announced in September 2015 and reached general availability in February 2016, positioning Google Cloud as a platform for open-source big data workloads. The service was initially focused on Hadoop and Spark on Compute Engine. Dataproc on GKE was introduced in 2020, enabling Kubernetes-based deployment. Dataproc Serverless for Spark batch workloads launched in general availability in 2022, followed by Serverless interactive sessions (Jupyter notebooks with Spark) in 2023. Google has progressively enhanced Dataproc with autoscaling policies, custom machine types, GPU support for Spark ML workloads, and integration with Vertex AI Workbench.
