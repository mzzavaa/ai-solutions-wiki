Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) is a fully managed service that runs open-source Apache Airflow on AWS. It handles the provisioning, patching, scaling, and maintenance of Airflow's scheduler, workers, and web server, allowing teams to focus on writing DAGs rather than managing infrastructure. MWAA integrates natively with AWS services including S3, Glue, EMR, SageMaker, and Lambda, making it the standard choice for orchestrating data and ML pipelines within the AWS ecosystem.

Official documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mwaa/

## Key Capabilities

- **Managed Airflow Infrastructure** - Automatically provisions and scales Airflow schedulers, workers, and web servers with no need to manage EC2 instances, containers, or databases for metadata storage
- **Native AWS Integration** - Pre-configured connections to AWS services via Airflow provider packages, enabling DAGs to orchestrate S3 operations, Glue crawlers, EMR clusters, SageMaker training jobs, and more
- **DAG Storage on S3** - DAG files, plugins, and requirements are stored in S3 and automatically synced to the Airflow environment, simplifying CI/CD workflows for pipeline code
- **Private Network Isolation** - Environments run within a customer VPC with configurable public or private web server access, meeting enterprise security requirements

## AWS/Cloud Equivalent

Amazon MWAA is the AWS-managed version of Apache Airflow. Google Cloud Composer provides the equivalent managed Airflow service on GCP. Azure Data Factory offers a different approach to workflow orchestration with a visual designer rather than code-first DAGs, though Azure also supports Airflow via third-party deployments. Prefect and Dagster are modern open-source alternatives that address some of Airflow's architectural limitations, particularly around dynamic workflows and local development experience.

## Origins and History

Amazon MWAA was announced at AWS re:Invent 2020 and reached general availability in early 2021. The service was created to address the operational complexity of self-hosting Apache Airflow, which requires managing a scheduler, web server, metadata database, and worker fleet. Before MWAA, AWS customers typically ran Airflow on ECS, EKS, or EC2 with significant operational overhead. MWAA supports Airflow 2.x versions and tracks upstream releases, typically making new Airflow versions available within a few months of their open-source release. In 2023, AWS added support for larger environment classes and improved auto-scaling of worker capacity to handle bursty DAG execution patterns.
