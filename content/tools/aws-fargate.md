AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers that works with both Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). With Fargate, you define your container image, CPU, memory, and networking requirements, and AWS handles provisioning, scaling, and managing the underlying server infrastructure. There are no EC2 instances to patch, scale, or secure. For AI workloads, Fargate is well-suited to running inference endpoints, data processing containers, and API services where you want container flexibility without cluster management overhead.

Official documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/AWS_Fargate.html

## Key Capabilities

- **Serverless Containers** - Run containers without provisioning or managing EC2 instances, eliminating the need for capacity planning, patching, and cluster scaling
- **ECS and EKS Compatibility** - Works as a launch type for both ECS tasks and EKS pods, letting teams choose their preferred container orchestration platform
- **Per-Task Resource Allocation** - Each task or pod receives its own dedicated compute and memory, providing workload isolation without the noisy neighbor problem of shared instances
- **Integrated Auto Scaling** - Combined with ECS Service Auto Scaling or Kubernetes HPA, Fargate scales container count based on CPU, memory, or custom CloudWatch metrics

## AWS/Cloud Equivalent

AWS Fargate provides serverless container execution within ECS and EKS. Google Cloud Run offers a similar serverless container experience with simpler configuration and automatic scale-to-zero, though it targets stateless HTTP workloads more specifically. Azure Container Instances (ACI) provides on-demand containers without orchestration. For AI inference workloads, the choice between Fargate and Lambda depends on execution duration (Lambda has a 15-minute limit), container image requirements, and whether GPU access is needed (Fargate does not currently support GPUs; use EC2-backed ECS/EKS for GPU workloads).

## Origins and History

AWS Fargate was announced at re:Invent 2017 and launched with ECS support. EKS support followed in December 2019. Fargate was created to address the operational burden of managing EC2-based container clusters, where teams spent significant effort on instance patching, AMI updates, capacity management, and bin-packing optimization. The service introduced Fargate Spot in December 2019, providing up to 70% cost savings for fault-tolerant workloads. Ephemeral storage was expanded from 20 GB to 200 GB in 2021, enabling larger container workloads. Fargate has become the default launch type for many ECS workloads, with AWS recommending it as the starting point unless specific EC2 features (GPU, custom AMIs, high IOPS storage) are required.
