Azure Event Hubs is Microsoft Azure's fully managed, real-time data ingestion service built for big data streaming scenarios. It can receive and process millions of events per second with low latency, serving as the front door for streaming data pipelines that feed AI and analytics workloads. Events published to Event Hubs are retained for a configurable period (up to 90 days or unlimited with the Premium and Dedicated tiers), allowing multiple consumers to process the same stream independently and at their own pace.

The service uses a partitioned consumer model where events are distributed across partitions for parallel processing. Producers send events to an event hub, and consumer groups read from it independently, enabling multiple downstream applications to process the same data stream simultaneously. For AI workloads, common patterns include streaming IoT sensor data for anomaly detection models, ingesting clickstream data for real-time personalization, aggregating log data for security AI models, and feeding real-time feature computation for online ML inference. Event Hubs integrates natively with Azure Stream Analytics for real-time SQL-based processing, Azure Functions for event-driven compute, and Azure Synapse Analytics for combined streaming and batch analytics.

A critical differentiator is the Event Hubs for Apache Kafka feature, which provides a Kafka-compatible endpoint that allows existing Kafka producers and consumers to connect to Event Hubs without code changes. This enables teams to migrate from self-managed Kafka clusters to a fully managed service or to use Kafka client libraries and ecosystem tools (Kafka Connect, Kafka Streams, Schema Registry) with Event Hubs as the broker. The Dedicated tier provides single-tenant clusters for workloads requiring guaranteed capacity and the highest throughput.

## Key Capabilities

- **Massive Scale Ingestion** - Processes millions of events per second with configurable throughput units, auto-inflate scaling, and partition-based parallelism
- **Kafka Compatibility** - Native Kafka endpoint enables existing Kafka applications and ecosystem tools to work with Event Hubs without code changes
- **Schema Registry** - Centralized schema management for Avro, JSON Schema, and custom formats ensures schema evolution and compatibility across producers and consumers
- **Capture** - Automatically captures streaming data to Azure Blob Storage or Data Lake Storage in Avro or Parquet format for batch analytics

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Event Hubs is Azure's counterpart to Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka). Both provide managed streaming platforms with Kafka compatibility, but Event Hubs offers a native Azure protocol alongside the Kafka endpoint and includes built-in Capture for automatic data lake integration, while MSK runs actual Apache Kafka brokers providing full Kafka API compatibility and configuration control.

## Origins and History

Azure Event Hubs launched in general availability in March 2015 as Azure's first dedicated big data streaming service. The Kafka-compatible endpoint was introduced in GA in September 2018, significantly broadening adoption among teams with existing Kafka investments. Event Hubs Dedicated, providing single-tenant clusters, launched in 2019. The Premium tier, offering a middle ground between Standard and Dedicated with enhanced isolation and predictable latency, reached GA in February 2022. Schema Registry support was added in 2021.
