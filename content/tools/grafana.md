Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability that provides rich, interactive dashboards for visualizing time series data from virtually any data source. It has become the standard visualization layer in modern observability stacks, connecting to Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Loki (logs), Tempo (traces), CloudWatch, BigQuery, and over 150 other data sources through its plugin system. Grafana enables teams to build unified dashboards that correlate metrics, logs, and traces from disparate systems.

Grafana's visualization capabilities include a wide range of panel types: time series graphs, heatmaps, histograms, gauges, stat panels, tables, geomaps, node graphs, flame graphs, and more. Dashboards support template variables for dynamic filtering, annotations for marking events, and alerting rules that can trigger notifications via email, Slack, PagerDuty, OpsGenie, and other channels. Grafana's alerting engine (unified alerting, introduced in Grafana 8) provides multi-dimensional alerts with support for alert grouping, silencing, and routing through a built-in notification policy system.

Grafana is used by hundreds of thousands of organizations, from startups to enterprises, for infrastructure monitoring, application performance management, business analytics, and IoT dashboards. Grafana Labs, the company behind Grafana, offers Grafana Cloud (a managed observability platform including Grafana, Prometheus-compatible Mimir, Loki for logs, and Tempo for traces) and Grafana Enterprise with additional data sources, reporting, and access control features.

## Key Capabilities

- **150+ Data Source Plugins** - Native and community connectors for Prometheus, Elasticsearch, InfluxDB, PostgreSQL, cloud services, and many more
- **Unified Alerting** - Multi-data-source alerting with configurable rules, notification policies, contact points, and silencing/muting
- **Dashboard Templating** - Variables, repeating panels, and annotations for building reusable, dynamic dashboards across environments
- **Explore Mode** - Ad-hoc query interface for investigating metrics, logs, and traces without building a dashboard first

## Cloud Equivalents

Grafana is the open-source alternative to AWS Managed Grafana (which runs Grafana itself), Azure Monitor dashboards, and Google Cloud Monitoring dashboards. AWS, Azure, and Google all offer Grafana as a managed service, validating its position as the industry standard. Self-hosted Grafana provides unlimited users, dashboards, and alerts at no license cost.

## Origins and History

Grafana was created by Torkel Odegaard in January 2014 as a fork of Kibana 3, reimagined for time series metrics visualization. The first release focused on Graphite and InfluxDB as data sources. Grafana is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL v3). Grafana Labs was founded in 2014 by Odegaard, Anthony Woods, and Raj Dutt, and has raised over $450 million in funding. Key milestones include Grafana 7.0 (2020) with the new panel editor and transformations, and Grafana 8.0 (2021) with unified alerting.
