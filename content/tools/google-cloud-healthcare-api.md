Google Cloud Healthcare API is a managed service for storing, processing, and analyzing healthcare data in industry-standard formats. It supports FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) for clinical data, DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) for medical imaging, and HL7v2 for healthcare messaging. The API provides a standards-compliant interface that allows healthcare organizations to ingest data from electronic health record (EHR) systems, medical devices, and imaging equipment, then make that data available for analytics, machine learning, and application development.

The Healthcare API is designed to bridge the gap between healthcare data systems and modern cloud analytics. Clinical data stored in FHIR format can be exported to BigQuery for SQL-based analytics, enabling population health analysis, clinical research queries, and operational reporting. DICOM imaging data can be fed into Vertex AI for training medical imaging ML models -- such as pathology slide analysis, radiology screening, or dermatology classification. HL7v2 messages can be routed through Pub/Sub for real-time processing, enabling clinical event-driven architectures. This integration between healthcare data formats and GCP's analytics and AI services is the core value proposition.

The service handles healthcare-specific compliance requirements including HIPAA (with a Business Associate Agreement), HITRUST, and data residency controls. It provides consent management for patient data access, de-identification for research datasets (removing or masking protected health information), and audit logging through Cloud Audit Logs. The FHIR store supports FHIR R4, the current standard version, with full CRUD operations, search, history, and transaction bundles. Healthcare organizations use the API as a clinical data lake, aggregating data from multiple EHR systems into a unified, queryable format.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Format Support** - Native storage and API access for FHIR R4, DICOM, and HL7v2 data, covering clinical records, medical imaging, and healthcare messaging.
- **BigQuery Export** - Stream FHIR data to BigQuery for SQL analytics, population health research, and ML feature engineering.
- **De-Identification** - Automated removal or masking of protected health information (PHI) for research datasets, configurable via de-identification templates.
- **Consent Management** - Patient-level consent enforcement that controls which users and applications can access specific patient data.

## AWS Equivalent

Cloud Healthcare API is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon HealthLake. Both services provide FHIR-based clinical data storage with analytics integration. HealthLake focuses primarily on FHIR with built-in NLP for medical text, while the Healthcare API supports FHIR, DICOM, and HL7v2 in a single service. The Healthcare API's DICOM support for medical imaging is a differentiator -- AWS handles DICOM through Amazon HealthImaging as a separate service.

## Origins and History

Google Cloud Healthcare API was announced at the HIMSS healthcare conference in March 2018 as a beta service, initially supporting FHIR and DICOM. HL7v2 support was added during the beta period. The service reached general availability in November 2020. De-identification capabilities were introduced in 2019, enabling research use cases. BigQuery streaming export for FHIR data launched in 2021, simplifying analytics workflows. Google has partnered with major EHR vendors including Epic and Cerner to facilitate data interoperability, and the Healthcare API underlies Google's Health AI research initiatives, including medical imaging and clinical NLP projects.
