ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system that enables real-time analytical query processing on billions of rows with sub-second latency. It uses a column-oriented storage format with aggressive data compression, vectorized query execution exploiting SIMD instructions, and a massively parallel processing architecture to achieve query performance that frequently surpasses commercial data warehouses on equivalent hardware.

ClickHouse supports a rich SQL dialect with extensions for analytical functions, approximate query processing (HyperLogLog, quantile sketches), materialized views for incremental aggregation, and array/nested data type manipulation. Its MergeTree engine family provides flexible primary key indexing, data partitioning, TTL-based data lifecycle management, and automatic background merges. ClickHouse can ingest millions of rows per second per node and scales horizontally through sharding and replication. It integrates with data pipelines via Kafka, S3, JDBC/ODBC, and native protocol connectors, and serves as a backend for visualization tools like Grafana and Superset.

ClickHouse has been adopted for real-time analytics, observability data (logs, metrics, traces), time-series analysis, and ad-hoc business intelligence at companies including Cloudflare, Uber, eBay, Spotify, and Cisco. ClickHouse, Inc. offers ClickHouse Cloud, a managed service available on AWS, GCP, and Azure, providing serverless scaling and separation of storage and compute.

## Key Capabilities

- **Vectorized Execution** - SIMD-optimized query engine that processes data in columnar batches for maximum CPU throughput
- **Real-Time Ingestion** - Handles millions of inserts per second with MergeTree engines performing background optimization
- **Materialized Views** - Incrementally maintained aggregations that update automatically as new data arrives
- **Compression** - Column-oriented storage with LZ4 and ZSTD compression achieving 10-40x compression ratios on typical analytics data

## Cloud Equivalents

ClickHouse is the open-source alternative to AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Azure Synapse Analytics for analytical workloads. Managed cloud data warehouses offer elastic scaling and zero administration, while ClickHouse provides superior raw query performance per dollar and full control over data locality and retention policies.

## Origins and History

ClickHouse was created by Alexey Milovidov at Yandex in 2009 for the Yandex.Metrica web analytics service, which needed to process over 20 billion events per day. It was open-sourced under the Apache License 2.0 in June 2016. ClickHouse, Inc. was founded in 2021 by Alexey Milovidov and Yury Izrailevsky, with significant venture funding to build ClickHouse Cloud. The project has accumulated over 35,000 GitHub stars and has one of the most active contributor communities among open-source databases.
