Google Document AI is a document understanding platform that uses machine learning to automatically classify documents and extract structured data from unstructured and semi-structured content. It goes beyond basic OCR by understanding document layout, tables, forms, and the semantic relationships between fields. Document AI processes PDFs, scanned images, and digital documents, returning structured data that can be fed directly into business workflows, databases, or downstream AI pipelines.

The platform offers a library of pre-trained processors (called "parsers") for common document types. These include specialized models for invoices, receipts, bank statements, pay stubs, tax forms (W-2, 1099), procurement documents, identity documents (passports, driver's licenses), and lending documents (mortgage applications, income statements). Each parser extracts document-type-specific fields -- for example, the invoice parser extracts vendor name, invoice number, line items, totals, and payment terms without any configuration. This pre-trained approach dramatically reduces the time to production compared to building custom extraction rules.

For documents not covered by pre-trained parsers, Document AI offers Custom Document Extractor, which allows teams to train extraction models on their own labeled data. The Document AI Workbench provides a labeling interface for annotating documents and training custom models. Organizations can also use the Document AI Warehouse for managing and searching extracted document data at scale, combining extraction with storage, search, and governance. The entire platform integrates with Cloud Storage for input, BigQuery for structured output, and Cloud Workflows for orchestration.

## Key Capabilities

- **Pre-Trained Processors** - Specialized extraction models for over 20 document types including invoices, receipts, identity documents, and financial forms, requiring no training data.
- **Table and Form Extraction** - Identifies table structures and form field-value pairs with high accuracy, preserving document layout and relationships between fields.
- **Custom Document Extractor** - Train custom extraction models on proprietary document types using the Document AI Workbench labeling and training interface.
- **Document AI Warehouse** - A managed document management layer for storing, searching, and governing extracted document data at enterprise scale.

## AWS Equivalent

Document AI is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon Textract. Both services extract text, tables, and form data from documents using ML. Textract focuses on generic extraction (text, tables, forms, queries) while Document AI provides a broader library of document-type-specific pre-trained parsers. Document AI's Custom Document Extractor is comparable to Textract's Custom Queries and Amazon Comprehend's custom entity recognition for documents.

## Origins and History

Google Document AI was announced at Google Cloud Next 2020 in April 2020, consolidating several existing document processing capabilities into a unified platform. The initial launch included the OCR processor, form parser, and several specialized processors. In 2021, Google expanded the processor library significantly, adding lending, procurement, and identity document processors. The Custom Document Extractor launched in 2022, enabling custom model training. Document AI Warehouse was announced at Google Cloud Next 2022. The platform has been progressively integrated with Vertex AI, and Google has continued to expand the pre-trained processor library, with the contract and tax document processors launching in 2023.
