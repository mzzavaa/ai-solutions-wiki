Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML) is Microsoft's cloud-based platform for the complete machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation and experimentation through model training, deployment, and monitoring. It provides a managed environment where data scientists and ML engineers can work with notebooks, automated ML, drag-and-drop designers, and code-first SDKs to build production-grade models. Azure ML sits alongside Azure OpenAI in the Azure AI portfolio: Azure OpenAI provides access to pre-built foundation models, while Azure ML provides the infrastructure to train custom models or fine-tune existing ones on proprietary data.

The platform centers around a workspace that organizes all ML assets -- datasets, experiments, models, endpoints, and compute resources. Azure ML supports training on managed compute clusters that auto-scale based on job queue depth, including GPU-optimized VMs for deep learning workloads. The service integrates natively with Azure Blob Storage and Data Lake Storage for data access, and with Azure DevOps and GitHub for MLOps CI/CD pipelines. Responsible AI features including model interpretability dashboards, fairness assessments, and error analysis tools are built into the platform.

Azure ML's managed endpoints simplify model deployment by handling infrastructure provisioning, scaling, load balancing, and monitoring automatically. Real-time endpoints serve synchronous predictions with auto-scaling, while batch endpoints process large datasets asynchronously. The managed online endpoints support blue-green deployments and traffic splitting for safe model rollouts. For teams working with foundation models, Azure ML's model catalog provides access to hundreds of open-source models from Hugging Face, Meta, and others, with one-click deployment and fine-tuning capabilities.

## Key Capabilities

- **Automated ML (AutoML)** - Automatically selects algorithms, tunes hyperparameters, and generates feature engineering pipelines for classification, regression, forecasting, and computer vision tasks
- **ML Pipelines** - Reproducible, reusable workflows that chain data preparation, training, evaluation, and deployment steps with version tracking and lineage
- **Responsible AI Dashboard** - Integrated tools for model interpretability, fairness analysis, error analysis, and counterfactual what-if exploration
- **Managed Endpoints** - One-click deployment with auto-scaling, blue-green deployments, and built-in monitoring for both real-time and batch inference scenarios

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Machine Learning is Azure's counterpart to Amazon SageMaker. Both provide end-to-end ML platforms, but Azure ML's tighter integration with the Microsoft ecosystem (Azure DevOps, Power BI, Microsoft 365) and its Responsible AI Dashboard differentiate it, while SageMaker offers deeper integration with the broader AWS service portfolio and a more mature spot instance training capability.

## Origins and History

Azure Machine Learning was originally launched in preview as Azure ML Studio in June 2014 as a drag-and-drop experiment authoring tool. The service was substantially re-architected and relaunched as Azure Machine Learning service in December 2018 with a Python SDK-first approach. The current v2 SDK and CLI, which unified the developer experience, reached general availability in May 2022. The model catalog with open-source foundation models was introduced at Build 2023 in May 2023, and prompt flow for LLM application development was added later that year.
