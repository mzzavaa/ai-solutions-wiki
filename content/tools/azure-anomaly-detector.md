Azure Anomaly Detector is an Azure AI service that detects anomalies in time series data without requiring machine learning expertise or labeled training data. The service uses unsupervised learning models, primarily based on Microsoft Research's Spectral Residual (SR) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms, that automatically learn the normal patterns in time series data and flag data points that deviate significantly. It is used in scenarios such as monitoring business KPIs for unexpected changes, detecting equipment malfunctions from sensor telemetry, identifying fraud patterns in transaction data, and spotting anomalies in application performance metrics.

The service provides two detection modes. Univariate anomaly detection analyzes a single time series and identifies points that fall outside expected boundaries. It handles seasonality, trends, and irregular patterns automatically without parameter tuning. The API accepts a batch of time series data points and returns anomaly flags, expected values, and upper/lower boundaries for each point. The streaming (last point) mode evaluates whether the most recent data point is anomalous, enabling real-time monitoring scenarios. Multivariate anomaly detection, a more advanced capability, analyzes correlations across multiple time series simultaneously to detect anomalies that would be invisible when examining each series independently -- for example, detecting a subtle equipment degradation pattern visible only in the correlation between temperature, vibration, and power consumption.

The multivariate detector uses a Graph Attention Network to model inter-variable dependencies and identify groups of variables contributing to each anomaly. This is particularly valuable for IoT and industrial monitoring scenarios where systems have dozens or hundreds of correlated sensors. The service requires a training step for multivariate detection (providing historical normal data), after which it can evaluate new data windows for anomalies. Both univariate and multivariate APIs are accessible via REST endpoints and client SDKs for Python, C#, JavaScript, and Java.

## Key Capabilities

- **Unsupervised Detection** - Automatically learns normal patterns from time series data without labeled anomaly examples or manual threshold configuration
- **Multivariate Analysis** - Detects complex anomalies across correlated time series using Graph Attention Networks that model inter-variable dependencies
- **Real-Time Streaming** - Last-point detection mode evaluates the most recent data point against historical patterns for real-time monitoring integration
- **Root Cause Contribution** - Multivariate detection identifies which variables contributed most to each detected anomaly, accelerating investigation

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Anomaly Detector is Azure's counterpart to Amazon Lookout for Metrics. Both provide managed anomaly detection for time series data, but Anomaly Detector offers both univariate and multivariate modes with different algorithms suited to different complexity levels, while Lookout for Metrics focuses on monitoring business metrics with built-in data source connectors and automated alerting. Anomaly Detector provides more algorithmic flexibility; Lookout for Metrics provides a more turnkey monitoring experience.

## Origins and History

Azure Anomaly Detector was first announced in preview at Ignite 2018 and reached general availability on March 3, 2020. The univariate detection algorithm is based on Microsoft Research's Spectral Residual and CNN approach published at KDD 2019. Multivariate anomaly detection, based on Graph Attention Network research, was added in GA in 2021. Microsoft announced in September 2023 that the standalone Anomaly Detector service would be retired in October 2026, with its capabilities being integrated into Azure AI services and Microsoft Fabric for a more unified analytics and AI experience.
