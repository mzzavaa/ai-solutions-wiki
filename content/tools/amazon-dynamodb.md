Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service provided by AWS that supports key-value and document data models. It delivers consistent single-digit millisecond response times at any scale, making it a foundational service for applications that require low-latency data access. DynamoDB handles table creation, scaling, backups, and replication without requiring database administration. For AI workloads, DynamoDB serves as a fast metadata store, session state backend, feature store for real-time inference, and event-driven data source via DynamoDB Streams.

Official documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/

## Key Capabilities

- **Serverless Scaling** - Automatically scales throughput capacity up and down based on traffic patterns with on-demand or provisioned capacity modes, requiring no capacity planning for unpredictable workloads
- **Single-Digit Millisecond Latency** - Consistent low-latency reads and writes regardless of table size, critical for real-time AI inference pipelines that require fast feature lookups
- **DynamoDB Streams** - Captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications, enabling event-driven architectures where data changes trigger Lambda functions for AI processing
- **Global Tables** - Fully managed multi-region, multi-active replication for globally distributed applications requiring local read and write performance

## AWS/Cloud Equivalent

DynamoDB is AWS's flagship NoSQL database. Azure Cosmos DB offers similar globally distributed NoSQL capabilities with additional multi-model support (graph, Cassandra, MongoDB APIs). Google Cloud Firestore provides a document database with real-time synchronization and offline support, while Google Cloud Bigtable targets wide-column analytical workloads at petabyte scale. DynamoDB's pricing model based on read/write capacity units and its deep integration with Lambda and other AWS services make it the natural choice within the AWS ecosystem.

## Origins and History

Amazon DynamoDB was announced at AWS re:Invent in January 2012, building on the principles described in the 2007 Amazon Dynamo paper authored by Werner Vogels and colleagues. That paper described the internal key-value store Amazon used for its shopping cart and other highly available services. DynamoDB took those distributed systems concepts and delivered them as a fully managed cloud service. DynamoDB Streams launched in 2015, enabling event-driven architectures. Global Tables for multi-region replication followed in 2017. On-demand capacity mode, which eliminated the need for provisioned throughput planning, was introduced at re:Invent 2018. The service has since added features including PartiQL (SQL-compatible query language), export to S3, and integration with AWS Glue for ETL processing.
