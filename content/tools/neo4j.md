Neo4j is the world's most widely deployed graph database, designed to store, manage, and query highly connected data using a native graph storage and processing engine. Unlike relational databases that use joins to traverse relationships (with performance degrading as data grows), Neo4j stores relationships as first-class citizens alongside nodes, enabling constant-time relationship traversal regardless of dataset size. This makes Neo4j exceptionally performant for queries that involve multiple hops across relationships, such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, network analysis, and knowledge graphs.

Neo4j uses the property graph model, where data is represented as nodes (entities) with labels and properties, connected by typed, directed relationships that also carry properties. The primary query language is Cypher, a declarative, pattern-matching query language designed specifically for graphs, which uses an intuitive ASCII-art syntax to describe graph patterns (e.g., `(person)-[:KNOWS]->(friend)`). Neo4j also supports the GQL (Graph Query Language) standard and provides APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher), an extensive library of over 450 procedures and functions for data integration, graph algorithms, and utility operations. The Graph Data Science (GDS) library offers production-grade implementations of graph algorithms including PageRank, community detection, pathfinding, centrality, and node embedding.

Neo4j is used across industries for fraud detection (financial services), recommendation systems (e-commerce), identity and access management, network and IT operations, supply chain management, and knowledge graph construction for AI/RAG applications. Companies including eBay, NASA, Walmart, and UBS rely on Neo4j for production graph workloads.

## Key Capabilities

- **Native Graph Storage** - Index-free adjacency ensures constant-time relationship traversal regardless of total graph size
- **Cypher Query Language** - Intuitive, declarative pattern-matching language for expressing complex graph queries with ASCII-art syntax
- **Graph Data Science** - Library of 65+ graph algorithms for PageRank, community detection, pathfinding, similarity, and node embeddings
- **ACID Transactions** - Full transactional support with ACID compliance for reliable, consistent graph operations

## Cloud Equivalents

Neo4j is the open-source alternative to AWS Neptune, Azure Cosmos DB (Gremlin API), and Google Cloud's graph capabilities. AWS Neptune supports different query languages (Gremlin, SPARQL, openCypher), while Neo4j offers the most mature Cypher/GQL implementation, the richest graph algorithm library, and the largest graph database ecosystem.

## Origins and History

Neo4j was created by Emil Eifrem, Johan Svensson, and Peter Neubauer, with development beginning in 2000 and the first public release in 2007. Neo4j, Inc. (originally Neo Technology) was founded in 2007 in Sweden. The Community Edition is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v3), while the Enterprise Edition requires a commercial license. Neo4j has raised over $580 million in venture funding. Key milestones include the introduction of Cypher (2011), the Graph Data Science library (2020), and vector search integration for AI/RAG applications (2023).
