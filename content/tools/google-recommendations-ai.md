Google Recommendations AI is a managed service that generates personalized product and content recommendations using deep learning models. It is part of Google Cloud's Vertex AI Search and Commerce suite (formerly Retail AI) and is designed primarily for retail and e-commerce use cases, though it can serve any content recommendation scenario. The service uses the same recommendation technology that powers personalization on YouTube and Google Shopping, adapted for external organizations to integrate into their own applications.

Recommendations AI works by ingesting a product catalog, user behavior events (views, clicks, add-to-cart, purchases), and optional user attributes. It then trains deep learning models that learn item-to-item relationships and user preference patterns. The service supports multiple recommendation types: "Recommended for you" (personalized to individual users), "Others you may like" (similar items), "Frequently bought together" (complementary items), and "Recently viewed" (session-based recommendations). Models are retrained automatically as new behavioral data arrives, adapting to changing trends and seasonal patterns without manual intervention.

The service is optimized for the retail domain with features like revenue optimization (weighing higher-margin items in recommendations), price reranking (adjusting recommendations based on current pricing), and catalog filtering (excluding out-of-stock or restricted items). For broader personalization use cases beyond retail, Vertex AI Search provides a more general discovery platform that combines search and recommendation. Organizations typically integrate Recommendations AI through its REST API or client libraries, embedding recommendation panels in product detail pages, home pages, shopping carts, and email campaigns. A/B testing is built in, allowing teams to compare recommendation model performance against baselines.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multiple Recommendation Models** - Pre-built model types for personalized recommendations, similar items, complementary products, and session-based suggestions.
- **Automatic Model Retraining** - Models retrain continuously on new behavioral data, adapting to trends, seasonality, and inventory changes without manual intervention.
- **Revenue Optimization** - Optional objective tuning that balances relevance with revenue impact, promoting higher-margin items when relevance is comparable.
- **Real-Time Event Ingestion** - User events (clicks, views, purchases) are ingested in real time and influence recommendations within minutes.

## AWS Equivalent

Recommendations AI is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon Personalize. Both services provide managed recommendation engines that train on user behavior data. Amazon Personalize offers more flexibility in recipe selection (algorithms like HRNN, SIMS, and user segmentation), while Recommendations AI is more opinionated toward retail use cases with built-in revenue optimization and catalog management. Personalize supports broader use cases beyond retail more naturally, while Recommendations AI leverages Google's retail-specific domain expertise.

## Origins and History

Recommendations AI was announced at Google Cloud Next 2019 in April 2019 and reached general availability in early 2021. The service built on Google's internal recommendation systems and was initially branded as part of the Retail API. In 2022, Google reorganized its commerce and discovery offerings under the Vertex AI Search and Commerce umbrella (formerly Discovery AI and Retail AI). The Retail API, which includes Recommendations AI and Retail Search, was rebranded as Vertex AI Search for Commerce. Google has continued to enhance the recommendation models, adding support for multi-objective optimization and improved cold-start handling for new users and items.
