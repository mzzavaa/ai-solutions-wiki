Azure Logic Apps is Microsoft Azure's cloud-based workflow orchestration platform that enables the creation of automated, multi-step workflows connecting hundreds of services and systems. It provides a visual designer for building integration workflows that span Azure services, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, on-premises systems, and third-party SaaS applications. In AI solution architectures, Logic Apps orchestrates complex processing chains that involve multiple AI service calls, human approval steps, conditional branching, and data routing -- all without writing extensive code.

The platform offers more than 1,000 pre-built connectors organized into categories: Standard connectors (HTTP, Schedule, Azure services), Enterprise connectors (SAP, IBM MQ, Oracle), and custom connectors that wrap any REST API. Each connector provides triggers (events that start a workflow) and actions (steps that perform work). For AI pipelines, commonly used actions include calling Azure OpenAI for text generation, invoking Azure AI Services for document processing or translation, querying Azure AI Search for retrieval-augmented generation, and sending results via email, Teams, or Slack. Workflows support parallel branches, loops, conditional expressions, error handling with retry policies, and variable management.

Logic Apps comes in two hosting models. The Consumption plan runs individual workflows in a multi-tenant environment with pay-per-execution pricing, suitable for lighter integration scenarios. The Standard plan (based on the Azure Functions runtime) provides single-tenant hosting with support for multiple workflows per app, virtual network integration, and local development using Visual Studio Code. The Standard plan also supports stateless workflows for high-throughput, low-latency scenarios where execution history does not need to be retained. Both models integrate with Azure Monitor for logging and diagnostics.

## Key Capabilities

- **1,000+ Connectors** - Pre-built connectors to Azure services, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SAP, Salesforce, and hundreds of SaaS applications enable broad integration without custom code
- **Visual Workflow Designer** - Browser-based and VS Code-based designers for building complex multi-step workflows with branching, loops, and error handling
- **Built-In AI Actions** - Native actions for Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Services, and Azure AI Search simplify building AI-powered automation workflows
- **Hybrid Connectivity** - On-premises data gateway and virtual network integration connect cloud workflows to systems behind corporate firewalls

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Logic Apps is Azure's counterpart to AWS Step Functions. Both provide workflow orchestration with visual designers, but Logic Apps emphasizes breadth of integration through its massive connector library and low-code accessibility, while Step Functions offers tighter integration with AWS services and a more developer-oriented state machine model with finer-grained execution control and Express Workflows for high-throughput scenarios.

## Origins and History

Azure Logic Apps launched in general availability in July 2016, evolving from the earlier Azure BizTalk Services and leveraging the Azure App Service platform. The service was Microsoft's answer to the growing iPaaS (Integration Platform as a Service) market. Logic Apps Standard (single-tenant), built on the Azure Functions runtime, reached GA in November 2021, providing enterprise-grade isolation, local development, and DevOps integration. Throughout 2023-2024, Microsoft added native AI-focused connectors for Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Services, reflecting the growing demand for AI-integrated business workflows.
