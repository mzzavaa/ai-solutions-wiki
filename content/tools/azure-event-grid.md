Azure Event Grid is Microsoft Azure's fully managed event routing service designed to build reactive, event-driven applications. It uses a publish-subscribe model where event sources (Azure services, custom applications, or SaaS partners) publish events, and subscribers (Azure Functions, Logic Apps, webhooks, or other services) receive and react to those events. In AI pipeline architectures, Event Grid serves as the nervous system that connects data arrival, processing steps, and notification delivery without polling or custom integration code.

Event Grid handles discrete events -- notifications that something happened -- as opposed to Event Hubs, which handles high-volume data streams. When a new blob is uploaded to Azure Storage, a document is indexed in Azure AI Search, a resource is created or modified, or a custom application emits a domain event, Event Grid delivers that event to all registered subscribers within seconds. The service guarantees at-least-once delivery with 24-hour retry and dead-lettering for events that cannot be delivered. Events conform to the CloudEvents v1.0 specification, an industry standard that ensures interoperability across cloud platforms.

For AI workloads, Event Grid commonly triggers processing chains: a file upload triggers document extraction, extraction completion triggers AI analysis, and analysis completion triggers notification delivery or database updates. The namespace topics feature, introduced with Event Grid's MQTT broker capabilities, supports high-throughput publish-subscribe scenarios with pull-based delivery, enabling consumers to process events at their own pace. Event Grid also supports advanced filtering on event properties, allowing subscribers to receive only the specific events they care about without server-side filtering logic.

## Key Capabilities

- **CloudEvents Standard** - Native support for the CloudEvents v1.0 specification ensures interoperability and avoids vendor lock-in for event schemas
- **Advanced Filtering** - Subscribers can filter events by subject, event type, data fields, and custom properties, receiving only relevant events
- **MQTT Broker** - Built-in MQTT v3.1.1 and v5 broker support enables IoT device communication and bidirectional messaging alongside cloud event routing
- **Dead-Letter and Retry** - Configurable retry policies and dead-letter destinations ensure no events are silently lost

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Event Grid is Azure's counterpart to Amazon EventBridge. Both provide serverless event routing with filtering and multiple target support. Event Grid's native MQTT broker capability gives it an edge for IoT scenarios, while EventBridge offers deeper integration with the AWS service ecosystem and a broader set of SaaS partner event sources through its partner event buses.

## Origins and History

Azure Event Grid was announced at Ignite 2017 and reached general availability on January 31, 2018. It was one of the first cloud services designed natively around the CloudEvents specification, which was later adopted as a CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) project. The namespace topics feature and MQTT broker capability were introduced in preview in 2023 and reached GA in 2024, significantly expanding Event Grid from pure event routing into a combined messaging and eventing platform.
