Apache Airflow is a platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. Workflows are defined as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of tasks using Python code, which gives developers the full power of a programming language for dynamic pipeline generation, branching logic, and parameterization. Airflow's web-based UI provides rich visualization of pipelines, monitoring of running tasks, and management of workflow execution history.

Airflow's architecture consists of a scheduler that triggers workflows and submits tasks, an executor that determines how tasks run (locally, on Celery workers, on Kubernetes pods, or via other backends), a metadata database for state tracking, and a web server for the UI. The platform ships with a vast library of operators and hooks for interacting with external systems including cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery), messaging systems, and APIs. The TaskFlow API, introduced in Airflow 2.0, simplifies DAG authoring with Python decorators and automatic XCom data passing between tasks.

Airflow has become the most widely adopted open-source workflow orchestration tool, used by thousands of organizations including Airbnb (where it originated), Google, Twitter, PayPal, and Slack. Google Cloud Composer is a fully managed Airflow service, and AWS offers Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow). The project has a vibrant contributor community and an extensive ecosystem of provider packages.

## Key Capabilities

- **Python-Native DAGs** - Workflows defined as Python code enabling dynamic generation, parameterization, and integration with any Python library
- **Extensive Operator Library** - Hundreds of pre-built operators for cloud services, databases, APIs, and file systems via provider packages
- **Rich Web UI** - Browser-based interface for monitoring, triggering, and debugging workflows with Gantt charts and task logs
- **Pluggable Executors** - Support for local, Celery, Kubernetes, and custom executors to match diverse infrastructure requirements

## Cloud Equivalents

Apache Airflow is the open-source alternative to AWS Step Functions, Google Cloud Composer (which runs Airflow itself), and Azure Data Factory. Unlike event-driven serverless orchestrators like Step Functions, Airflow excels at scheduled batch workflows but requires managing its own infrastructure when self-hosted.

## Origins and History

Apache Airflow was created by Maxime Beauchemin at Airbnb in October 2014 and open-sourced in June 2015. It entered the Apache Incubator in March 2016 and became a top-level Apache project in January 2019. Airflow is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Beauchemin later founded Preset (focused on Apache Superset) and contributed to the broader data tooling ecosystem. Airflow 2.0, released in December 2020, introduced a major architectural overhaul with a new scheduler, TaskFlow API, and improved scalability.
