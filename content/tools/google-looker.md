Looker is Google Cloud's enterprise business intelligence (BI) platform. Unlike traditional BI tools that extract data into a separate analytics layer, Looker uses an in-database architecture that pushes SQL queries to the underlying data warehouse (most commonly BigQuery, but also Snowflake, Redshift, and 60+ other databases). This means all users query the same live data with consistent business logic, eliminating the "multiple versions of truth" problem that plagues organizations with extract-based BI tools.

Looker's differentiating feature is LookML, a modeling language that defines business metrics, dimensions, and relationships in code. Data teams write LookML models that translate business concepts ("revenue," "active users," "churn rate") into the exact SQL that produces those metrics. Every dashboard, report, and embedded analytics application references the same LookML definitions, ensuring consistency. LookML models are version-controlled in Git, reviewed through pull requests, and deployed through a CI/CD process -- bringing software engineering practices to analytics. This governed approach is particularly valuable in AI-driven organizations where metrics definitions must be precise for model training and evaluation.

Looker integrates deeply with BigQuery and the broader GCP AI ecosystem. Analysts can explore Vertex AI model predictions stored in BigQuery through Looker dashboards, build monitoring dashboards for ML pipeline performance, and create self-service analytics for business users who consume AI-generated insights. Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio), a lighter-weight free visualization tool, complements Looker for simpler reporting needs. Looker also offers embedded analytics, allowing organizations to integrate interactive dashboards and visualizations directly into their own applications through APIs and SDKs.

## Key Capabilities

- **LookML Semantic Layer** - A code-based modeling language that defines metrics, dimensions, and relationships once and applies them consistently across all analytics surfaces.
- **In-Database Architecture** - Queries run directly in the data warehouse, ensuring analysis uses live data without extract delays and leveraging the warehouse's compute power.
- **Embedded Analytics** - Embed interactive dashboards, visualizations, and data experiences directly into applications via APIs, SDKs, and pre-built components.
- **Git-Based Version Control** - LookML models are stored in Git repositories, enabling code review, branching, and CI/CD workflows for analytics governance.

## AWS Equivalent

Looker is Google Cloud's counterpart to Amazon QuickSight. QuickSight emphasizes ease of use and cost efficiency with SPICE (in-memory caching) and pay-per-session pricing, while Looker focuses on governance and consistency through the LookML semantic layer. Looker is better suited for organizations that need rigorous metric definitions and embedded analytics at scale, while QuickSight is more accessible for ad hoc visualization. Looker also competes with Tableau (Salesforce) and Power BI (Microsoft).

## Origins and History

Looker was founded in 2012 by Lloyd Tabb and Ben Porterfield in Santa Cruz, California. Tabb, a veteran database engineer, created LookML to solve the problem of inconsistent metrics across business teams. Google acquired Looker in February 2020 for $2.6 billion, making it a cornerstone of Google Cloud's analytics portfolio. Following the acquisition, Google integrated Looker more deeply with BigQuery and introduced Looker Studio (rebranding Google Data Studio) in October 2022. Looker has been progressively enhanced with generative AI features, including natural language query capabilities powered by Vertex AI, announced at Google Cloud Next 2023.
