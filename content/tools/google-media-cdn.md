Google Media CDN is a content delivery network purpose-built for media and large-scale content delivery. It runs on the same global edge infrastructure that delivers YouTube, serving content from over 1,300 edge locations in more than 200 countries and territories. Media CDN is designed for streaming video (live and on-demand), large file downloads, game updates, and other media-heavy workloads that require high throughput, low latency, and massive scale. It is distinct from Cloud CDN, Google's general-purpose CDN -- Media CDN is optimized specifically for media delivery with higher throughput guarantees and advanced media-specific features.

Media CDN integrates with Google Cloud's media processing services to form a complete media pipeline. Video content stored in Cloud Storage can be transcoded using the Transcoder API (for adaptive bitrate encoding in HLS and DASH formats), protected with DRM, and delivered through Media CDN to global audiences. For AI-enhanced media pipelines, upstream services like Video Intelligence API, Speech-to-Text (for subtitle generation), and Translation API (for subtitle localization) process content before it reaches the delivery layer. Media CDN handles the last mile, ensuring that processed content reaches viewers with minimal buffering and startup latency.

The service supports advanced delivery features including token-based authentication for content protection, origin failover for high availability, cache warming for predictable content launches, and real-time logging for delivery analytics. Media CDN's routing policies support geolocation-based routing, header-based routing, and A/B testing of different content variants. For live streaming, Media CDN provides low-latency delivery with sub-second cache fill times and origin shielding to protect origin servers from thundering herd problems during popular live events.

## Key Capabilities

- **YouTube-Scale Infrastructure** - Delivers content from Google's 1,300+ edge locations, the same infrastructure serving YouTube's billions of daily video views.
- **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming** - Native support for HLS and DASH streaming formats with intelligent cache management for multiple bitrate representations.
- **Token-Based Authentication** - Signed URLs and signed cookies for content protection, ensuring only authorized viewers access premium content.
- **Real-Time Logging and Analytics** - Streaming logs to Cloud Logging and BigQuery for real-time delivery analytics, quality of experience monitoring, and CDN performance optimization.

## AWS Equivalent

Media CDN is Google Cloud's counterpart to the combination of Amazon CloudFront (CDN) and AWS Elemental MediaPackage (media origin and packaging). CloudFront is a general-purpose CDN that handles media delivery among other workloads, while Media CDN is purpose-built for media. AWS MediaConvert handles transcoding (comparable to Google's Transcoder API). Media CDN's advantage is its YouTube-derived infrastructure and scale, while CloudFront benefits from broader feature coverage and tighter integration with the AWS ecosystem.

## Origins and History

Media CDN was announced at Google Cloud Next 2022 in October 2022 and reached general availability in late 2022. It was Google Cloud's response to growing demand for a media-grade CDN that could match the performance and scale of proprietary CDNs operated by Netflix, Disney+, and other streaming services. The service was built by the same team that operates YouTube's delivery infrastructure. Prior to Media CDN, GCP customers used Cloud CDN for all content delivery, which lacked media-specific optimizations. The Transcoder API, which pairs with Media CDN for video processing, launched in general availability in 2021. Google has continued to enhance Media CDN with features like origin shielding, cache warming, and advanced routing policies.
