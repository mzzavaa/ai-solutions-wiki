Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework built by the team behind Pydantic, the data validation library used in FastAPI and LangChain. Its core differentiator is type safety: agent inputs, tool parameters, and model outputs are defined with Python type annotations and validated by Pydantic models at runtime. This makes agent code more maintainable and catches integration errors early.

## Type-Safe Agent Design

In most agent frameworks, tool inputs and outputs are loosely typed dicts or strings. Pydantic AI uses Pydantic models as the schema for every tool, and validates inputs before calling your tool function and outputs before returning them to the model.

```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ProductQuery(BaseModel):
    product_id: str
    include_pricing: bool = True

class ProductResult(BaseModel):
    name: str
    price: float | None
    inventory: int

agent = Agent(
    "bedrock:us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6",
    result_type=ProductResult
)

@agent.tool
async def get_product(ctx, query: ProductQuery) -> ProductResult:
    ...
```

If the model passes a `product_id` that is an integer, Pydantic coerces it to a string. If a required field is missing, validation fails with a clear error. This moves integration errors from silent failures to explicit exceptions.

## Structured Output Extraction

Pydantic AI's `result_type` parameter guarantees that the agent's final response conforms to a specified Pydantic model. The framework prompts the model to produce structured output and validates the response. If validation fails, it automatically retries with error feedback to the model.

This is valuable for AI pipelines that feed agent output into downstream systems: you get a typed Python object rather than a string that you must parse and validate yourself.

## Bedrock Backend

Pydantic AI supports Amazon Bedrock as a model backend using the `bedrock:` prefix on model IDs. Authentication uses standard AWS credential resolution (IAM roles, environment variables, profiles). This means Pydantic AI agents run on Lambda or ECS with instance role credentials, without API key management.

Supported Bedrock models include Claude (all versions), Titan, Llama, and Mistral - any model Bedrock supports for the Converse API.

## Dependency Injection

Pydantic AI uses a `RunContext` dependency injection pattern. Tool functions receive a context object typed to a user-defined dependencies class. This allows swapping real implementations for test fakes:

```python
@dataclass
class Deps:
    db: Database

agent = Agent("bedrock:...", deps_type=Deps)

@agent.tool
async def fetch_record(ctx: RunContext[Deps], id: str) -> Record:
    return await ctx.deps.db.get(id)
```

In tests, pass a mock `Database` object. In production, pass the real one. No mocking libraries needed.

## When to Choose Pydantic AI

Choose Pydantic AI when:
- Your project already uses Pydantic and FastAPI (compatible mental model)
- You need reliable structured output from agents
- Testability is a priority
- You are building Python-native backends where type safety is valued

LangGraph and Strands may be better fits for complex multi-agent orchestration or explicit workflow definition.
