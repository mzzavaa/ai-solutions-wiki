Azure Monitor is Microsoft Azure's unified observability platform that provides comprehensive monitoring for applications, infrastructure, and networks across cloud and on-premises environments. It collects metrics, logs, traces, and changes from virtually every Azure resource and correlates them in a single platform for analysis, visualization, and alerting. For AI workloads, Azure Monitor tracks the health and performance of inference endpoints, monitors pipeline execution, measures AI service latency and error rates, and provides the operational visibility needed to maintain production AI systems.

The platform is built around two core data stores. Azure Monitor Metrics stores lightweight, time-series numerical data that supports near-real-time alerting and fast dashboard rendering. Azure Monitor Logs (powered by Azure Data Explorer and queried with Kusto Query Language, or KQL) stores structured and semi-structured log data that supports complex ad-hoc analysis, correlation across resources, and long-term retention. Application Insights, a feature of Azure Monitor, provides application performance monitoring (APM) with distributed tracing, dependency mapping, live metrics streaming, and smart detection of anomalies -- essential for monitoring the performance of AI API endpoints and multi-service processing pipelines.

Azure Monitor integrates deeply with the Azure AI service ecosystem. Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Services, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure Functions all emit diagnostic logs and metrics to Azure Monitor automatically when configured. Custom metrics and traces from application code can be sent via the OpenTelemetry SDK or the Application Insights SDK. Alerts can trigger Azure Functions, Logic Apps, webhooks, ITSM integrations, or automated remediation runbooks when thresholds are breached, enabling self-healing AI pipeline architectures.

## Key Capabilities

- **Kusto Query Language (KQL)** - Powerful query language for analyzing logs and metrics with joins, aggregations, time series analysis, and machine learning operators
- **Application Insights** - APM with distributed tracing, live metrics, availability testing, and AI-powered smart detection of performance anomalies
- **Azure Monitor Alerts** - Multi-signal alerting on metrics, logs, and activity logs with configurable action groups for notification and automated response
- **Workbooks and Dashboards** - Interactive, parameterized reports and dashboards for custom monitoring views, shareable across teams

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Monitor is Azure's counterpart to Amazon CloudWatch. Both provide metrics, logs, alerting, and dashboarding, but Azure Monitor's KQL-based log analytics engine provides significantly more powerful ad-hoc query capabilities than CloudWatch Logs Insights, while CloudWatch has tighter default integration with AWS services and a simpler pricing model for basic metric monitoring.

## Origins and History

Azure Monitor has evolved through the consolidation of several previously separate monitoring services. The original Azure Diagnostics, Azure Alerts, and Log Analytics (originally Operations Management Suite/OMS, acquired through the Microsoft acquisition of InMon in 2007 and rebranded multiple times) were unified under the Azure Monitor brand starting in September 2018. Application Insights, originally a Visual Studio Online feature, was incorporated into Azure Monitor in 2019. The unified Azure Monitor experience with integrated metrics, logs, and application monitoring reached maturity through 2019-2020. OpenTelemetry-based auto-instrumentation support was added in 2023.
