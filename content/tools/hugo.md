Hugo is a static site generator written in Go. It compiles Markdown content and HTML templates into static HTML/CSS/JS files that deploy to any web host. Build times are extremely fast - thousands of pages in seconds - making it practical for large documentation sites and wikis like this one.

Official documentation: https://gohugo.io/

## Why Hugo for AI Solution Sites

Documentation and knowledge base sites have content that changes regularly (new articles, updated guides) but does not require server-side rendering. Static files served from a CDN load faster, cost less to host, and have no runtime infrastructure to manage.

For AI solution wiki sites, Hugo provides:
- Simple Markdown authoring for non-developers
- Taxonomy support (categories, tags, industries) for content organization
- Configurable navigation and cross-linking
- Search integration (via Pagefind or Algolia)
- Git-based content workflow (PR reviews for article updates)

## Template System

Hugo uses Go's `html/template` package. Templates live in `layouts/` and define how content renders. Key concepts:

**Layouts** determine structure by content type and section. `layouts/_default/single.html` renders any single content page. `layouts/tools/single.html` overrides for the tools section.

**Partials** are reusable template fragments (`layouts/partials/header.html`, `layouts/partials/related-articles.html`). Call them with `{{ partial "related-articles" . }}`.

**Shortcodes** extend Markdown with custom HTML rendering. The `relref` shortcode generates relative URLs for cross-linking - for example, calling relref with a target filename produces a validated internal link. This is the pattern used throughout this wiki's articles.

**Front matter** metadata (`title`, `date`, `tags`, `categories`) drives taxonomy pages and is accessible in templates as `.Params`.

## Content Organization

Hugo uses the `content/` directory as the content root. Subdirectories become sections. `_index.md` files provide section metadata and landing page content. A file at `content/tools/aws-s3.md` is accessible at `/tools/aws-s3/`.

Hugo's taxonomy system automatically generates listing pages for any front matter array field declared in `config.toml`. This site uses `categories`, `tags`, `industries`, and `tools` taxonomies.

## Deployment Patterns

**GitHub Pages:** Add a GitHub Actions workflow that runs `hugo build` on push to main and deploys the `public/` directory. Hugo provides an official Actions workflow. Free for public repositories.

**AWS Amplify:** Connect the repository in Amplify Console, set build command to `hugo`, set publish directory to `public`. Amplify handles SSL, CDN distribution, and branch previews automatically.

**Cloudflare Pages:** Similar to Amplify, with fast global CDN and free tier. Supports Hugo build command natively.

## Speed Advantage

Hugo is consistently the fastest static site generator. Competing tools like Jekyll (Ruby), Gatsby (React), and Next.js (Node.js) take seconds to minutes for large sites. Hugo builds 10,000 pages in under 10 seconds. This matters for development iteration speed and CI/CD pipeline time.

## Origins and History

Hugo was created by Steve Francia (known online as spf13) and first released on July 5, 2013. Francia's motivation was frustration with the maintenance costs and performance limitations of dynamic content management systems like WordPress, as well as the slow build times of existing static site generators like Jekyll, which is written in Ruby.

Francia chose Go as the implementation language specifically for its concurrency features and compiled binary performance. The initial prototype was built during a focused weekend coding session, and Francia validated the concept by migrating his own WordPress blog, which contained over two hundred posts, to Hugo. The speed improvement was immediate and dramatic.

Since version 0.14 in 2015, Hugo has been led by Bjorn Erik Pedersen, with Francia moving on to join the core Go team at Google. The project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and has accumulated over 87,000 GitHub stars as of early 2026.
