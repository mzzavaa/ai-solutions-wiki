AWS Elemental MediaConvert is a file-based video transcoding service. It converts video files between formats, resolutions, and codecs, and applies processing like caption insertion, image overlay, and audio normalization. In AI pipelines it handles the heavy transcoding work that would be impractical on Lambda (file size limits, timeout limits) or expensive on EC2 (underutilized instances).

Official documentation: https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/

**Azure equivalent:** Azure Media Services. **GCP equivalent:** Google Cloud Transcoder API.

## Core Use Cases

**Format normalization before AI analysis:** AI services like Rekognition expect specific input formats. MediaConvert converts raw camera formats (MXF, R3D, XAVC) to H.264 MP4 before Rekognition receives them. This avoids codec compatibility errors and ensures consistent frame rates.

**Proxy generation for fast preview:** Create low-resolution proxy files (e.g., 360p H.264) alongside full-resolution originals. AI analysis runs against proxies to reduce cost; only selected segments get processed at full resolution.

**Output packaging for delivery:** After AI-driven editing selects segments, MediaConvert packages the output into adaptive bitrate formats (HLS, DASH) for streaming delivery.

**Caption embedding:** Combine AI-generated transcripts (from Amazon Transcribe) with the video using MediaConvert's caption insertion feature.

## Integration with AI Pipeline

MediaConvert fits between raw ingest and AI analysis. A typical flow:

1. Raw upload lands in S3 (`raw/` prefix)
2. EventBridge triggers a Lambda function
3. Lambda submits a MediaConvert job via the API
4. MediaConvert writes normalized output to S3 (`normalized/` prefix)
5. MediaConvert completion event triggers the next pipeline stage (Rekognition analysis, Transcribe, etc.)

The MediaConvert job specification is a JSON document describing input location, output groups, codecs, and settings. Jobs are submitted to a queue; multiple queues allow prioritization (rush jobs vs. batch overnight).

## Pricing Model

MediaConvert charges per minute of output video, with rates varying by output resolution. SD (below 720p) costs less than HD (720p-1080p), which costs less than UHD (4K+). The professional tier adds features like HDR processing. There are no per-job charges or queue fees.

For cost optimization, run analysis against SD proxies rather than HD originals when possible.

## Comparison with FFmpeg on Lambda

MediaConvert handles files of any size without Lambda's 15-minute timeout or 10 GB /tmp storage constraint. It also provides managed scaling - submit 100 jobs simultaneously and they process in parallel without managing infrastructure. However, MediaConvert has a higher per-minute cost than FFmpeg on a long-running EC2 instance for very high volumes.
