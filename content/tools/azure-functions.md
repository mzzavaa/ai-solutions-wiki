Azure Functions is Microsoft Azure's serverless compute service that lets developers run event-triggered code without provisioning or managing servers. In AI solution architectures, Functions serves as the glue layer that connects data ingestion, model invocation, and result delivery. When a new document lands in Blob Storage, a message arrives in a Service Bus queue, or an HTTP request hits an endpoint, Azure Functions executes the processing logic, calls Azure AI services, and routes the results downstream.

The service supports multiple programming languages including C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, PowerShell, and Go. Python is the most common choice for AI workloads due to the ecosystem of ML libraries. Functions provides two hosting models: the Consumption plan, where you pay only for execution time and the platform scales automatically from zero to thousands of concurrent instances, and the Premium plan, which keeps pre-warmed instances ready to eliminate cold start latency. The Flex Consumption plan, introduced in 2024, combines the scale-to-zero economics of Consumption with configurable always-ready instances.

For AI pipelines, Azure Functions commonly handles tasks such as preprocessing uploaded files before sending them to Azure AI services, aggregating and formatting results from multiple cognitive service calls, implementing webhook endpoints for asynchronous processing notifications, and managing retry logic for rate-limited API calls to Azure OpenAI or other model endpoints. The Durable Functions extension adds stateful orchestration capabilities, enabling complex multi-step workflows with fan-out/fan-in patterns, human interaction steps, and long-running processes that would be difficult to implement with plain functions alone.

## Key Capabilities

- **Multiple Trigger Types** - HTTP requests, Blob Storage events, Queue messages, Timer schedules, Event Grid events, and Cosmos DB change feed triggers connect functions to virtually any Azure service
- **Durable Functions** - Stateful orchestration extension enables complex workflows with chaining, fan-out/fan-in, async HTTP APIs, and monitoring patterns
- **Integrated Bindings** - Declarative input and output bindings connect to Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Service Bus, and other services without boilerplate connection code
- **Flexible Scaling** - Consumption plan scales to zero for cost efficiency; Premium plan provides pre-warmed instances for latency-sensitive AI inference endpoints

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Functions is Azure's counterpart to AWS Lambda. Both provide event-driven serverless compute, but Azure Functions' Durable Functions extension offers built-in stateful orchestration that Lambda requires Step Functions to achieve, while Lambda has a broader set of native event source integrations within the AWS ecosystem.

## Origins and History

Azure Functions was announced at the Build 2016 conference in March 2016 and reached general availability on November 15, 2016. The service was built on the existing Azure WebJobs SDK infrastructure. Durable Functions, the stateful orchestration extension, reached GA in May 2018. The v4 programming model for Node.js and the v2 model for Python, both simplifying the developer experience significantly, were released in 2023. Flex Consumption, a new hosting plan combining benefits of Consumption and Premium plans, entered general availability in 2024.
