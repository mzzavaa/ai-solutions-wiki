Azure Computer Vision is a cloud-based AI service within Azure AI Services that provides pre-trained deep learning models for analyzing images and videos. The service extracts rich visual information including object detection, image classification, text recognition (OCR), image captioning and dense captioning, face detection, spatial analysis, and background removal. Powered by Microsoft's Florence large vision model, the latest version (v4.0) provides significantly improved accuracy and capabilities compared to earlier versions. For AI pipelines, Computer Vision provides the visual understanding layer that processes images from cameras, documents, product photos, satellite imagery, and video streams.

The Image Analysis 4.0 API, built on the Florence foundation model, provides a unified endpoint for multiple vision tasks. Image captioning generates natural language descriptions of image content. Dense captioning provides descriptions for multiple regions within an image. Object detection identifies and locates objects with bounding boxes across thousands of object categories. Tagging assigns content tags with confidence scores. Smart cropping identifies the most important region of an image for aspect ratio-appropriate thumbnails. The multimodal embedding feature generates vector representations of both images and text in a shared embedding space, enabling semantic image search where text queries find visually relevant images without manual tagging.

OCR (optical character recognition) extracts printed and handwritten text from images and documents in over 160 languages. The Read API handles complex documents with mixed content including tables, headers, footnotes, and multiple columns, returning structured text output with bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and reading order detection. Spatial Analysis uses edge-deployed models to understand people's movement and presence in physical spaces from video feeds, enabling scenarios such as occupancy monitoring, social distancing compliance, queue management, and zone-based entry/exit counting. The service processes video on Azure Stack Edge devices for privacy and latency requirements.

- **Spatial Analysis** - Edge-deployed video analytics for people counting, movement tracking, occupancy monitoring, and zone-based event detection

## AWS Equivalent

Azure Computer Vision is Azure's counterpart to Amazon Rekognition. Both provide pre-trained vision models for image and video analysis, but Computer Vision's Florence foundation model-based architecture provides a unified model for multiple tasks with multimodal embeddings, while Rekognition offers separate models for specific tasks (face analysis, content moderation, custom labels). Computer Vision's spatial analysis for video is more advanced; Rekognition's face analysis and celebrity recognition features are more mature.

## Origins and History

Azure Computer Vision was one of the original Cognitive Services APIs, first offered as part of Project Oxford at Build 2015 in April 2015. It became part of Azure Cognitive Services in 2016. The Read API for advanced OCR was added in 2019. Spatial Analysis for video understanding launched in 2020. The major upgrade to Image Analysis 4.0, powered by the Florence large vision model developed by Microsoft Research, was released in GA in 2023. This version introduced multimodal embeddings, dense captioning, and significantly improved accuracy across all vision tasks. Background removal and custom model training on top of the Florence base model were added as additional capabilities in 2023-2024.
