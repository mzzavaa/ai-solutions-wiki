Tesseract is an open-source optical character recognition (OCR) engine that converts images of text into machine-readable text strings. It supports over 100 languages out of the box and can be trained to recognize additional languages and fonts. Tesseract is one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines available and has been continuously developed for over three decades, making it one of the longest-lived and most mature open-source projects in the document processing space.

Tesseract 4.0 introduced a neural network-based recognition engine using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, significantly improving accuracy over the previous character-pattern-matching approach, especially for complex layouts and degraded text. The engine processes images through a pipeline of binarization, layout analysis (detecting text blocks, columns, tables, and images), line finding, word segmentation, and character recognition. Tesseract accepts input in various image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PDF) and can output plain text, hOCR (HTML-based OCR format), PDF with embedded text, TSV, and ALTO XML. For best results, preprocessing steps like deskewing, denoising, and binarization (often done with libraries like OpenCV or ImageMagick) improve recognition accuracy.

Tesseract is used in document digitization, automated data entry, accessibility tools, license plate recognition, and archival projects. Libraries, government agencies, and enterprises use Tesseract for processing millions of documents. It is commonly integrated into larger document processing pipelines using Python wrappers like pytesseract, and serves as the OCR backbone in numerous commercial and open-source document management systems.

## Key Capabilities

- **LSTM Neural Network Engine** - Deep learning-based text recognition using LSTM networks for improved accuracy on diverse fonts and degraded text
- **100+ Languages** - Pretrained models for over 100 languages including right-to-left scripts, CJK characters, and historical typefaces
- **Multiple Output Formats** - Generates plain text, searchable PDF, hOCR, TSV, and ALTO XML with character-level confidence scores
- **Custom Training** - Training tools for creating new language models or fine-tuning existing models on domain-specific fonts and layouts

## Cloud Equivalents

Tesseract is the open-source alternative to AWS Textract, Azure AI Document Intelligence, and Google Cloud Vision OCR. Cloud OCR services provide higher accuracy on complex layouts (forms, tables, handwriting) and require no infrastructure management, while Tesseract offers zero-cost processing, offline capability, and full data privacy for document processing workflows.

## Origins and History

Tesseract was originally developed at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories in Bristol, England, between 1985 and 1994 by Ray Smith and others. It was open-sourced by HP in 2005 and subsequently sponsored by Google from 2006 to 2018, during which time Google funded significant improvements including the LSTM-based neural network engine. The project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0. Tesseract 4.0 (2018) marked the transition to neural network recognition, and Tesseract 5.0 (2021) improved the LSTM engine performance and API.
