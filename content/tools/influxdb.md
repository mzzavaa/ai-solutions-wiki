InfluxDB is a purpose-built time series database optimized for the storage and retrieval of timestamped data. It is designed to handle high write volumes and real-time queries on data from sources such as infrastructure monitoring, IoT sensors, application metrics, and financial market feeds. InfluxDB's storage engine uses a time-structured merge tree (TSM) that provides high compression ratios and fast writes, while its inverted index enables efficient filtering by tags (metadata dimensions).

InfluxDB provides its own query languages: InfluxQL (a SQL-like language) and Flux (a functional data scripting language introduced in InfluxDB 2.x for more complex transformations, alerting, and cross-measurement joins). The platform includes built-in data collection through Telegraf (an agent for collecting metrics from 300+ sources), task scheduling for periodic data processing, alerting with notification endpoints, and dashboard visualization. InfluxDB 3.x, the latest generation, moves to an Apache Arrow-based columnar engine with Apache Parquet storage and SQL/InfluxQL query support, improving analytical query performance significantly.

InfluxDB is one of the most widely deployed time series databases, with use cases spanning DevOps monitoring, IoT platforms, real-time analytics, and scientific data collection. It powers monitoring at organizations of all sizes and integrates naturally with Grafana for visualization and Telegraf for data collection. InfluxData, the company behind InfluxDB, offers InfluxDB Cloud as a managed service and InfluxDB Enterprise for clustered on-premises deployments.

## Key Capabilities

- **High Write Throughput** - TSM storage engine optimized for millions of points per second with automatic compression and compaction
- **Telegraf Integration** - Agent-based data collection framework with 300+ input plugins for infrastructure, databases, IoT protocols, and APIs
- **Built-In Task Engine** - Scheduled data processing tasks for downsampling, alerting, and ETL within the database itself
- **Flexible Retention Policies** - Automatic data expiration and downsampling to manage storage costs while preserving long-term trends

## Cloud Equivalents

InfluxDB is the open-source alternative to AWS Timestream, Azure Time Series Insights, and Google Cloud monitoring storage. Managed cloud time-series services offer deeper integration with their respective cloud ecosystems, while InfluxDB provides a portable, cloud-agnostic solution with a rich integrated toolset (Telegraf, dashboards, alerting).

## Origins and History

InfluxDB was created by Paul Dix and founded as InfluxData (originally Errplane) in 2012, with the first release of InfluxDB in 2013. The open-source single-node version was initially released under the MIT License, later moving to the Apache License 2.0. In 2023, InfluxData announced InfluxDB 3.0, a ground-up rewrite in Rust using Apache Arrow, DataFusion, and Parquet as its core technologies. The clustered and cloud versions of InfluxDB are proprietary, while the single-server community edition remains open-source.
