TimescaleDB is an open-source time-series database implemented as a PostgreSQL extension, combining the reliability and ecosystem of PostgreSQL with optimizations specifically designed for time-series workloads. By building on PostgreSQL rather than creating a new database from scratch, TimescaleDB provides full SQL support, joins with relational data, existing PostgreSQL tooling compatibility, and the ability to handle both time-series and relational data in a single system.

TimescaleDB's core innovation is the hypertable, which automatically partitions time-series data into chunks by time (and optionally by space dimensions like device ID or location). This partitioning is transparent to users, who interact with hypertables as if they were standard PostgreSQL tables. The chunked architecture enables efficient data retention policies, tiered storage to S3 for older data, and parallelized queries across time ranges. Additional time-series features include continuous aggregates (automatically maintained materialized views), compression achieving 90-95% storage reduction, and specialized analytical functions for time-weighted averages, gap filling, and downsampling.

TimescaleDB is widely used in IoT monitoring, financial market data, DevOps observability, and industrial telemetry. Its PostgreSQL compatibility makes it attractive to teams already invested in the PostgreSQL ecosystem who need time-series capabilities without adopting a separate specialized database. Timescale, Inc. provides a managed cloud service (Timescale Cloud) and the Timescale community edition.

## Key Capabilities

- **Full PostgreSQL Compatibility** - Works as a PostgreSQL extension, supporting full SQL, joins, stored procedures, and the entire PostgreSQL tooling ecosystem
- **Automatic Time Partitioning** - Hypertables transparently partition data by time for efficient ingestion, queries, and data lifecycle management
- **Continuous Aggregates** - Incrementally maintained materialized views that automatically update as new data arrives
- **Columnar Compression** - Automatic compression of older chunks achieving 90-95% storage savings while maintaining query capability

## Cloud Equivalents

TimescaleDB is the open-source alternative to AWS Timestream, Azure Time Series Insights, and Google Cloud's time-series capabilities in BigTable. Unlike purpose-built time-series databases, TimescaleDB's PostgreSQL foundation allows combining time-series and relational queries in a single system, though purpose-built services may offer simpler operational models for pure time-series workloads.

## Origins and History

TimescaleDB was created by Ajay Kulkarni and Mike Freedman (a Princeton University computer science professor) and first released in April 2017. The project was initially licensed under the Apache License 2.0, with the enterprise features under the Timescale License. In 2023, Timescale shifted the entire codebase to the Timescale License (a source-available license), before transitioning again in 2024 to make the project more open. Timescale, Inc. was founded in 2015 and has raised over $180 million in venture funding.
