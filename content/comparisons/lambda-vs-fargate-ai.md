Lambda and Fargate are both serverless compute options on AWS, but they differ significantly in how they handle AI workloads. Lambda offers event-driven, short-lived functions. Fargate runs containers without managing servers. For AI workloads, the differences in cold start behavior, resource limits, runtime duration, and GPU support drive the choice.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Lambda | Fargate |
|---|---|---|
| Max memory | 10 GB | 120 GB |
| Max vCPUs | 6 | 16 |
| GPU support | No | No (ECS on EC2 for GPUs) |
| Max runtime | 15 minutes | Unlimited |
| Cold start | Seconds (variable) | 30-60 seconds (container pull) |
| Minimum cost unit | Per invocation + duration | Per second (1 min minimum) |
| Container support | Container images up to 10 GB | Any container |
| Scaling | Instant (concurrent executions) | Minutes (new tasks) |
| Persistent storage | /tmp (10 GB) | EFS mount, EBS |

## AI Inference Workloads

### Lambda for Inference

**Works well for:** Lightweight inference with small models. Calling external AI APIs (Bedrock, OpenAI). Preprocessing and postprocessing around AI calls. Low-volume, sporadic inference requests.

**Example:** A Lambda function receives an API request, calls Bedrock for LLM inference, and returns the result. The model runs on Bedrock's infrastructure; Lambda handles the orchestration.

**Limitations:** No GPU means CPU-only local inference. 10 GB memory limits model size. 15-minute timeout limits long-running inference. Cold starts add 1-10 seconds of latency depending on package size.

**Cold start mitigation:** Use Provisioned Concurrency to keep Lambda functions warm. This eliminates cold starts but adds ongoing cost (you pay for the provisioned capacity whether it is used or not).

### Fargate for Inference

**Works well for:** Running model serving containers (TGI, vLLM, Triton). Longer-running inference pipelines. Workloads that need more memory than Lambda provides. Applications that need persistent connections (WebSocket, gRPC).

**Example:** A Fargate task runs a FastAPI container with a scikit-learn or small transformer model loaded in memory. An Application Load Balancer routes inference requests to the container.

**Limitations:** No GPU support on Fargate. For GPU inference, use ECS with EC2 GPU instances. Scaling is slower than Lambda (new container spin-up takes 30-60 seconds).

## AI Processing Workloads

### Lambda for Processing

**Document processing.** Lambda triggered by S3 uploads to process documents: extract text, classify, extract entities. Each document is processed independently, and Lambda's parallel execution handles bursts efficiently.

**Event-driven AI pipelines.** Lambda functions orchestrated by Step Functions for multi-step AI processing: ingest, preprocess, call AI service, postprocess, store results.

**Preprocessing for training.** Lambda functions transform raw data (resize images, clean text, validate records) before feeding into training pipelines.

### Fargate for Processing

**Batch AI processing.** Long-running batch jobs that process large datasets. No time limit, more memory, persistent storage.

**Model training preprocessing.** Complex data preparation that exceeds Lambda's 15-minute limit or 10 GB memory.

**Streaming AI pipelines.** Continuous processing of streaming data (Kinesis, Kafka) where maintaining state across messages is important.

## Cost Comparison

**Lambda pricing:** $0.20 per million requests + $0.0000166667 per GB-second. You pay only when code runs. Idle time costs nothing.

**Fargate pricing:** Per-second billing based on vCPU and memory. 1 vCPU + 2 GB memory costs approximately $0.04/hour ($29/month continuous).

**Break-even analysis:**

For sporadic workloads (less than 20% utilization), Lambda is cheaper because you pay nothing when idle.

For steady workloads (more than 40% utilization), Fargate is cheaper because the per-invocation overhead of Lambda accumulates.

For AI inference specifically: if you are calling external AI APIs (Bedrock), Lambda's cost is usually a small fraction of the AI API cost itself. The compute cost matters more when running models locally.

## Scaling Behavior

**Lambda** scales instantly by running more concurrent executions. Can handle sudden spikes (0 to 1000 concurrent executions in seconds). Each execution is isolated. Default limit: 1000 concurrent executions per account (adjustable).

**Fargate** scales by launching new tasks. Each new task takes 30-60 seconds to start (container image pull, startup). For predictable scaling, use target tracking auto-scaling. For bursty workloads, maintain a minimum task count to absorb initial spikes.

For AI workloads with unpredictable burst patterns, Lambda's instant scaling is a significant advantage. For steady-state workloads, Fargate's scaling is adequate.

## Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Lambda + Bedrock

Lightest weight. Lambda handles API requests and calls Bedrock for AI inference. No local model loading. Fastest to implement.

### Pattern 2: Fargate + Local Model

Medium weight. Fargate runs a container with a model loaded in memory. Good for small to medium models that fit in Fargate's memory (up to 120 GB). No GPU means CPU inference only.

### Pattern 3: ECS on EC2 + GPU

Heavyweight. ECS tasks on GPU EC2 instances for large model inference. Full GPU access. Most complex to manage but necessary for large models.

### Pattern 4: Lambda + Fargate Hybrid

Lambda handles lightweight requests and preprocessing. Fargate handles heavy processing and model serving. Step Functions orchestates between them.

## Recommendation

**Use Lambda** for: AI API orchestration (calling Bedrock, OpenAI), event-driven document processing, lightweight preprocessing, and sporadic workloads.

**Use Fargate** for: running model serving containers, batch processing, long-running AI pipelines, and workloads needing more than 10 GB memory.

**Use ECS on EC2** for: GPU-dependent inference (large transformers, vision models) where Fargate and Lambda cannot provide the required compute.

For most LLM-based applications that use managed AI services (Bedrock), Lambda is sufficient and simpler. For applications that run models locally, Fargate (or EC2 for GPU) is necessary.
