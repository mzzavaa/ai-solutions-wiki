AI serving systems must handle high-throughput, low-latency prediction requests. The choice between gRPC and REST for inter-service communication affects latency, throughput, developer experience, and ecosystem compatibility. This comparison covers the trade-offs for AI/ML microservice architectures.

## Protocol Overview

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** uses HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 with JSON payloads. It is the default for web APIs, widely understood, and supported by every programming language and framework. REST APIs are resource-oriented and use standard HTTP methods.

**gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)** uses HTTP/2 with Protocol Buffer (protobuf) binary serialization. It provides strongly-typed service definitions, bidirectional streaming, and automatic client/server code generation from proto files.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | REST (JSON/HTTP) | gRPC (Protobuf/HTTP2) |
|---|---|---|
| Serialization | JSON (text-based) | Protobuf (binary) |
| Payload size | Larger (human-readable) | 3-10x smaller (binary) |
| Latency | Higher (text parsing) | Lower (binary parsing, HTTP/2) |
| Streaming | Limited (SSE, WebSocket) | Native bidirectional streaming |
| Code generation | OpenAPI/Swagger (optional) | Built-in from proto files |
| Type safety | Runtime validation | Compile-time type checking |
| Browser support | Native | Requires gRPC-Web proxy |
| Tooling | Postman, curl, browser | grpcurl, BloomRPC, Evans |
| Load balancing | Standard HTTP LB | Requires HTTP/2-aware LB |
| Human readability | High (JSON) | Low (binary) |

## Performance for AI Workloads

**Serialization overhead.** AI inference requests often contain large numerical arrays (feature vectors, embeddings, image tensors). JSON serialization of a 768-dimensional float vector is roughly 10KB; the protobuf equivalent is roughly 3KB. For high-throughput services processing thousands of requests per second, this 3x reduction in payload size translates to meaningful bandwidth savings and lower serialization/deserialization latency.

**Latency.** In benchmarks, gRPC typically achieves 2-5x lower latency than REST for small payloads and 5-10x lower latency for large numerical payloads. For AI serving with strict latency SLAs (under 50ms), gRPC's advantage can be the difference between meeting and missing the SLA.

**Throughput.** HTTP/2 multiplexing allows gRPC to handle more concurrent requests on a single connection. For batch inference services that receive bursts of requests, gRPC handles higher concurrency without the connection overhead of HTTP/1.1.

**Streaming.** gRPC's bidirectional streaming is valuable for real-time AI applications: streaming audio for speech recognition, streaming video frames for object detection, or streaming token generation for large language models. REST requires WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for streaming, which adds complexity.

## Developer Experience

**REST advantages.** Every developer knows REST. Debugging is straightforward: inspect JSON payloads in browser dev tools or curl. Integration testing is easy with tools like Postman. Documentation is mature (OpenAPI/Swagger). External consumers and partners universally support REST.

**gRPC advantages.** Proto files serve as a single source of truth for the API contract. Client and server code is auto-generated, eliminating the common REST problem of client implementations drifting from the API specification. Type safety catches errors at compile time rather than runtime.

**Learning curve.** gRPC has a steeper learning curve. Developers must learn protobuf syntax, understand HTTP/2 behavior, configure gRPC-specific load balancers, and use specialized debugging tools. For teams new to gRPC, the initial productivity cost is real.

## When to Choose REST

- External-facing APIs consumed by third-party developers
- Browser-based clients without gRPC-Web infrastructure
- Teams without gRPC experience and tight delivery timelines
- Low-throughput use cases where serialization overhead is negligible
- Prototyping and early-stage products where developer velocity matters most

## When to Choose gRPC

- Internal microservice communication with strict latency requirements
- High-throughput serving with large numerical payloads (embeddings, feature vectors)
- Streaming AI workloads (real-time speech, video, token generation)
- Polyglot environments where auto-generated clients reduce integration effort
- Systems where type safety and contract enforcement prevent production incidents

## Hybrid Approach

Many AI platforms use both: REST for external APIs (customer-facing endpoints, third-party integrations) and gRPC for internal communication (model serving, feature retrieval, inter-service calls). An API gateway translates between REST and gRPC at the boundary. This gives external consumers the familiarity of REST while internal services benefit from gRPC's performance.

Frameworks like TensorFlow Serving and Triton Inference Server support both REST and gRPC endpoints natively, allowing teams to choose per use case without changing the serving infrastructure.
