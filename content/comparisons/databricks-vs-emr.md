Databricks and Amazon EMR both run Apache Spark for large-scale data processing. For AI teams, they serve as platforms for data preparation, feature engineering, distributed model training, and data exploration. The choice affects developer experience, MLOps capabilities, and operational overhead.

## Platform Overview

**Databricks** is a managed data and AI platform built around Apache Spark. It includes collaborative notebooks, MLflow integration, Delta Lake for reliable data storage, Unity Catalog for governance, and Mosaic AI for model serving. Available on AWS, Azure, and GCP.

**Amazon EMR** is a managed Hadoop/Spark service on AWS. It provides the compute infrastructure for running Spark, Hive, Presto, and other big data frameworks. EMR on EC2, EMR on EKS, and EMR Serverless offer different deployment models.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Databricks | EMR |
|---|---|---|
| Notebook experience | Collaborative notebooks (excellent) | EMR Studio notebooks (basic) |
| Spark optimization | Photon engine (3-8x faster) | Standard Spark |
| Data storage | Delta Lake (ACID, time travel) | Open formats on S3 |
| MLOps | MLflow (integrated), Model Serving | SageMaker integration |
| Feature store | Databricks Feature Store | SageMaker Feature Store (separate) |
| Data governance | Unity Catalog | Lake Formation (separate) |
| Auto-scaling | Yes (cluster and serverless) | Yes (managed scaling) |
| Serverless option | Serverless compute | EMR Serverless |
| Multi-cloud | AWS, Azure, GCP | AWS only |

## Developer Experience

**Databricks** provides a significantly better developer experience for data scientists and ML engineers:
- Collaborative notebooks with real-time co-editing
- Built-in version control integration
- Interactive visualization
- Automatic cluster management (attach notebooks to clusters)
- Integrated experiment tracking (MLflow)
- One-click model deployment

**EMR** provides a more infrastructure-focused experience:
- EMR Studio offers notebook functionality but less polished than Databricks
- Cluster management requires more configuration
- MLflow and experiment tracking must be set up separately
- Model deployment goes through SageMaker (separate service)

For data science teams that spend most of their time in notebooks, Databricks is a clear productivity advantage.

## Performance

**Databricks Photon** is a C++ native query engine that replaces parts of the Spark execution engine. For SQL and DataFrame operations, Photon provides 3-8x speedup over standard Spark. This translates directly to faster feature engineering and data processing.

**EMR** runs standard Apache Spark. Performance is good but does not match Photon-optimized Databricks for comparable cluster sizes.

For the same data processing job, a smaller Databricks cluster with Photon often matches a larger EMR cluster, which can offset the per-unit price difference.

## MLOps Capabilities

**Databricks** has built-in MLOps:
- MLflow experiment tracking (automatic logging)
- MLflow Model Registry with approval workflows
- Databricks Feature Store with online/offline serving
- Model Serving for real-time inference endpoints
- Unity Catalog for ML artifact governance

**EMR** relies on external services for MLOps:
- MLflow can be self-hosted on EMR (manual setup)
- SageMaker provides model registry, training, and serving
- SageMaker Feature Store for feature management
- Step Functions for pipeline orchestration

Databricks provides a more integrated MLOps experience. EMR + SageMaker provides equivalent capabilities but requires more integration work.

## Cost

**Databricks:** Databricks Units (DBU) + cloud infrastructure cost. DBU pricing varies by workload type and cloud provider. Premium plan: approximately $0.07-0.55/DBU depending on tier. Infrastructure cost is additional. A typical ML workload cluster: $5-20/hour.

**EMR:** EC2 instance cost + EMR surcharge (approximately 25% of EC2 cost). EMR Serverless charges per vCPU-hour and memory-GB-hour. A typical ML workload cluster: $3-15/hour.

**Cost comparison:** EMR is typically 20-40% cheaper for comparable compute. However, Databricks' Photon acceleration can reduce the required cluster size, partially offsetting the price premium. Databricks' integrated features (MLflow, Feature Store) also reduce the cost of setting up and maintaining separate services.

Total cost of ownership (including engineering time for setup and maintenance) often favors Databricks for ML-focused teams and EMR for infrastructure-focused teams.

## When to Choose Databricks

- ML and data science are the primary use cases
- Team values an integrated notebook and MLOps experience
- Want built-in experiment tracking and model registry
- Need Delta Lake for reliable data management
- Multi-cloud deployment is a requirement
- Willing to pay the premium for developer productivity

## When to Choose EMR

- Cost is the primary driver
- Team has strong Spark and AWS infrastructure expertise
- Using SageMaker for model training and serving
- Need flexibility to run non-Spark frameworks (Hive, Presto, Flink)
- AWS-native architecture is preferred
- Minimal vendor dependencies beyond AWS

For organizations where AI is a core competency and data scientist productivity matters most, Databricks typically delivers better value. For organizations where data processing is a supporting function and cost efficiency is paramount, EMR provides capable infrastructure at lower cost.
