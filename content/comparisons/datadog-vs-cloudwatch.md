Monitoring AI systems requires tracking both infrastructure metrics (latency, throughput, errors) and ML-specific metrics (model accuracy, data drift, prediction distribution). Datadog and CloudWatch approach this from different starting points: CloudWatch is AWS-native with broad service integration, while Datadog is a third-party platform with richer visualization and cross-cloud capability.

## Core Capabilities

| Capability | CloudWatch | Datadog |
|---|---|---|
| AWS service metrics | Automatic, comprehensive | Via AWS integration |
| Custom metrics | Yes ($0.30/metric/month) | Yes (included in plans) |
| Dashboards | Yes (basic) | Yes (rich, interactive) |
| Alerting | CloudWatch Alarms | Monitors with ML-based anomaly detection |
| Log management | CloudWatch Logs | Datadog Logs |
| Tracing | X-Ray (separate service) | APM (integrated) |
| ML monitoring | No native support | ML Observability product |
| Cross-cloud | No (AWS only) | Yes (AWS, GCP, Azure, on-premise) |

## ML-Specific Monitoring

**CloudWatch** provides infrastructure metrics for AI services (SageMaker endpoint latency, Bedrock token counts, Lambda duration) but has no built-in ML model monitoring. To monitor model accuracy, data drift, and prediction quality, you must build custom solutions: push custom metrics to CloudWatch, build dashboards manually, and set up alarms on thresholds.

**Datadog** offers ML Observability as a product feature. It includes LLM monitoring (track token usage, latency, error rates, and costs across LLM providers), model performance tracking, and integration with ML frameworks. Datadog's anomaly detection can automatically identify unusual patterns in model metrics without manual threshold setting.

For teams that want out-of-the-box ML monitoring, Datadog has a significant advantage.

## Dashboard and Visualization

**CloudWatch dashboards** are functional but basic. They support metric graphs, text widgets, and alarms. Cross-account and cross-region dashboards are possible. The visual design is utilitarian.

**Datadog dashboards** are more sophisticated. Interactive, shareable, with templates for common use cases. Notebook-style dashboards combine metrics, logs, and annotations. Better for executive-level reporting and team collaboration.

For AI teams that need to communicate model performance to stakeholders, Datadog's visualization capabilities are stronger.

## Alerting

**CloudWatch Alarms** trigger on metric thresholds (static or anomaly detection). Actions include SNS notifications, Lambda invocation, and EC2 actions. Composite alarms combine multiple alarm conditions.

**Datadog Monitors** offer similar threshold-based alerting plus ML-powered anomaly detection, forecast-based alerts (alert before a metric crosses a threshold), and outlier detection. Notification integrations include Slack, PagerDuty, email, and webhooks.

For AI monitoring, where "normal" behavior changes as models are updated and data distributions shift, Datadog's ML-based alerting adapts better than static CloudWatch thresholds.

## Cost

**CloudWatch:** No base cost for standard AWS metrics. Custom metrics: $0.30/metric/month. Dashboards: $3/dashboard/month. Logs: $0.50/GB ingested. Alarms: $0.10/alarm/month. For a moderate AI system, CloudWatch costs $50-200/month.

**Datadog:** Infrastructure plan starts at $15/host/month. APM: $31/host/month. Log management: $0.10/GB ingested (plus $1.70/million log events indexed). ML Observability: additional cost. For a moderate AI system, Datadog costs $200-1000/month.

Datadog is 3-10x more expensive than CloudWatch for comparable monitoring coverage. The premium buys better visualization, ML-specific features, and cross-cloud capability.

## Integration with AI Services

**CloudWatch** automatically receives metrics from all AWS AI services:
- SageMaker (endpoint invocations, latency, GPU utilization)
- Bedrock (token counts, latency, throttling)
- Lambda (duration, errors, cold starts)
- Step Functions (execution metrics)

No configuration needed. Metrics appear automatically.

**Datadog** integrates with AWS services via the AWS integration, plus adds:
- LLM-specific dashboards for Bedrock, OpenAI, and Anthropic
- APM traces that follow requests through AI service calls
- Cost tracking per LLM provider and model
- Log correlation with trace and metric data

## When to Choose CloudWatch

- Tight budget and the monitoring investment must be minimal
- All infrastructure is on AWS
- Standard infrastructure monitoring is the primary need
- Team is comfortable building custom dashboards and metrics
- Organization policy requires AWS-native services

## When to Choose Datadog

- Need ML-specific monitoring out of the box
- Multi-cloud or hybrid infrastructure
- Rich dashboards and visualization are important for stakeholder reporting
- Want ML-powered anomaly detection for alerting
- Team prefers a unified observability platform (metrics, logs, traces, profiling)
- Budget supports the premium

## Hybrid Approach

Many teams use both: CloudWatch for AWS-native metrics and alarms (free, automatic), and Datadog for dashboards, APM, and ML-specific monitoring. Datadog ingests CloudWatch metrics, so the data flows naturally from one to the other.
