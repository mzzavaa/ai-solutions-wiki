Every AI initiative faces the build-vs-buy decision: develop a custom solution or purchase a commercial product. The answer depends on how differentiated the AI capability is to your business, the total cost of ownership, and your organization's ability to build and maintain AI systems.

## The Build Option

Building means developing a custom AI solution using foundation models, open-source tools, and your team's engineering capabilities.

**What you build:**
- Custom data pipelines for your specific data sources
- Models trained or fine-tuned on your domain data
- Application logic tailored to your business processes
- Integration with your existing systems
- Custom UI and user experience

**Advantages:**
- Full customization to your exact requirements
- Complete control over data, models, and behavior
- No vendor dependency or per-seat licensing
- Can become a competitive differentiator
- Full ownership of intellectual property

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires an AI-capable engineering team
- Longer time to initial deployment (months vs weeks)
- Ongoing maintenance responsibility (models, infrastructure, updates)
- Risk of building something that does not work
- Opportunity cost of engineering time

## The Buy Option

Buying means purchasing a commercial AI product that solves your problem out of the box or with configuration.

**What you buy:**
- SaaS AI products (AI-powered CRM, document processing, customer service)
- AI platform features (Salesforce Einstein, ServiceNow AI, Microsoft Copilot)
- Specialized AI solutions (medical AI, legal AI, financial AI products)

**Advantages:**
- Faster deployment (weeks vs months)
- Proven solution with existing customers
- Vendor handles maintenance, updates, and improvements
- No AI team required to get started
- Lower risk (the product already works)

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited customization
- Per-seat or per-usage licensing costs compound over time
- Vendor dependency (pricing changes, feature changes, discontinuation)
- Data leaves your control (sent to vendor's systems)
- Cannot differentiate from competitors using the same product

## Decision Framework

### Is AI a differentiator or a commodity?

**Differentiator:** The AI capability is central to your competitive advantage. How you process data, make predictions, or automate decisions is different from competitors and creates unique value. Examples: proprietary trading algorithms, unique recommendation engines, domain-specific models built on proprietary data.

**Commodity:** The AI capability is standard and similar across companies. You need it to operate but it does not differentiate you. Examples: email spam filtering, standard document OCR, generic chatbot for common FAQs.

**If differentiator: build.** Custom development protects your competitive advantage.
**If commodity: buy.** Commercial products deliver commodity capabilities faster and cheaper.

### Do you have the team?

Building AI requires ML engineers, data engineers, and software engineers with AI experience. If you do not have this team and cannot hire it, buying is the practical choice even if building would be ideal.

### What is the total cost of ownership?

Compare costs over 3 years:

**Build TCO:**
- Team cost: 3-5 engineers x $200K/year x 3 years = $1.8M-$3M
- Infrastructure: $2K-$20K/month x 36 months = $72K-$720K
- Development time before first value: 3-9 months of team cost with no return
- Ongoing maintenance: 1-2 FTEs dedicated after launch

**Buy TCO:**
- License/subscription: $50-$500/seat/month x seats x 36 months
- Implementation and integration: $50K-$500K (one-time)
- Customization: $20K-$200K (ongoing)
- Data migration and training: $10K-$50K

For 100 users at $200/seat/month, the 3-year buy cost is $720K + implementation. This is often less than the build cost, especially when accounting for the opportunity cost of engineering time.

### How specific are your requirements?

**Highly specific:** Your process is unique, your data is proprietary, and commercial products cannot accommodate your workflow. Build is necessary because no product fits.

**Standard with customization:** Your process is similar to others in your industry, with some unique aspects. Buy a product and customize it.

**Completely standard:** Your needs match what commercial products offer. Buy without hesitation.

## The Hybrid Approach

Many organizations find the best answer is a combination:

**Buy the platform, build the differentiation.** Use commercial AI infrastructure (Bedrock, SageMaker) for the platform layer. Build custom models, prompts, and business logic on top. This provides the infrastructure without the operational burden while preserving customization.

**Buy for some use cases, build for others.** Use commercial products for commodity AI needs (document processing, generic chatbots) and build custom solutions for differentiated capabilities.

**Start with buy, then build.** Purchase a commercial product to deliver value quickly. Learn from the experience what your actual requirements are. Then build a custom solution if the commercial product's limitations become significant.

## Common Mistakes

**Building everything from scratch.** Some teams default to building because they want complete control. This is expensive and slow for capabilities that are available commercially.

**Buying when the fit is poor.** Purchasing a product that covers 60% of requirements and then spending extensive effort customizing it to cover the remaining 40% can cost more than building from scratch.

**Not accounting for maintenance.** Build decisions often undercount the ongoing cost of maintaining, monitoring, and improving a custom AI system. Models degrade, data changes, and infrastructure needs updates.

**Vendor lock-in without exit strategy.** Buying without planning for the possibility that you may need to switch vendors. Understand data portability, contract terms, and migration paths.

**Ignoring the team you have.** The best technical decision is irrelevant if your team cannot execute it. Match the approach to your team's capabilities.

The build-vs-buy decision should be revisited periodically. As AI technology matures, more capabilities become commodity (favoring buy). As your organization's AI maturity grows, more custom solutions become feasible (expanding build options).
