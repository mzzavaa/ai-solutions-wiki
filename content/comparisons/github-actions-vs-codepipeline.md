CI/CD for AI workloads includes standard software CI/CD (code testing, building, deploying) plus ML-specific steps (model training, evaluation, model registry updates). GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline approach this differently.

## Platform Overview

**GitHub Actions** is a CI/CD platform integrated into GitHub. Workflows are defined in YAML files in the repository. Extensive marketplace of community-built actions. Runs on GitHub-hosted or self-hosted runners.

**AWS CodePipeline** is a managed CI/CD service on AWS. Pipelines are defined through the console, CLI, CloudFormation, or CDK. Integrates natively with AWS services. CodeBuild provides the build/execution environment.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | GitHub Actions | AWS CodePipeline |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline definition | YAML in repo | Console, CLI, CloudFormation, CDK |
| Trigger types | Push, PR, schedule, manual, webhook | CodeCommit, S3, GitHub, manual |
| Marketplace | 15,000+ community actions | AWS service integrations |
| GPU runners | Self-hosted only | CodeBuild GPU build environments |
| Parallel jobs | Matrix builds, concurrent jobs | Parallel stages and actions |
| Manual approvals | Environment protection rules | Manual approval action |
| Secrets management | GitHub Secrets + OIDC | AWS Secrets Manager, SSM Parameters |
| Artifact storage | GitHub Artifacts (90-day retention) | S3 |
| Cost | Free tier (2,000 min/month), then per-minute | Free (pay for CodeBuild and resources used) |

## ML-Specific Considerations

### Model Training in CI/CD

**GitHub Actions:** Cannot run GPU training on GitHub-hosted runners. For GPU training, use self-hosted runners on GPU instances, or trigger training on external services (SageMaker) from the workflow. Many teams use GitHub Actions to trigger SageMaker training jobs and wait for completion.

**CodePipeline:** CodeBuild supports GPU build environments (NVIDIA CUDA). Can run lightweight training directly in CodeBuild. For larger training, invoke SageMaker training jobs from CodeBuild. Native AWS integration simplifies IAM and networking.

### Model Evaluation

Both can run model evaluation as a pipeline step. GitHub Actions is simpler for evaluation that runs on CPU. CodePipeline/CodeBuild is simpler for evaluation that needs AWS resources (S3 data, SageMaker endpoints).

### Model Registry Integration

**GitHub Actions** can push to any model registry (MLflow, SageMaker) via CLI commands or API calls. Requires AWS credentials configuration (OIDC recommended).

**CodePipeline** integrates natively with SageMaker Model Registry. IAM roles provide access without credential management.

### Infrastructure as Code

Both support deploying AI infrastructure:
- GitHub Actions runs Terraform, CDK, or CloudFormation via CLI
- CodePipeline has native CloudFormation deploy actions

## Developer Experience

**GitHub Actions** is generally preferred by developers:
- YAML workflows live in the code repository
- Pull request integration is seamless (run tests on PRs, require passing checks)
- Rich ecosystem of pre-built actions
- Familiar interface for developers already using GitHub

**CodePipeline** is preferred by AWS platform teams:
- Deep AWS integration simplifies permissions and networking
- Visual pipeline designer in the console
- Native integration with AWS deployment services
- Better suited for complex multi-stage deployment pipelines

## Cost

**GitHub Actions:** Free tier includes 2,000 minutes/month for private repos. Additional minutes: $0.008/minute (Linux). Self-hosted runners are free (you pay for infrastructure).

**CodePipeline:** The pipeline itself is $1/month per active pipeline. CodeBuild charges: $0.005/minute for general1.small, $0.01/minute for general1.medium. GPU instances cost more.

For most AI projects with moderate CI/CD activity, both cost under $50/month. The cost difference is not a deciding factor.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: GitHub Actions + SageMaker

GitHub Actions handles code CI (tests, linting, building). For ML steps, Actions triggers SageMaker jobs (training, evaluation, deployment) using the AWS CLI. Results are reported back to the GitHub PR.

### Pattern 2: CodePipeline + SageMaker

CodePipeline orchestrates the full pipeline. CodeBuild runs tests and builds. SageMaker actions handle training and deployment. CloudFormation deploys infrastructure. Everything stays within AWS.

### Pattern 3: GitHub Actions for CI, CodePipeline for CD

GitHub Actions runs on every PR (tests, linting, evaluation). When code merges to main, it triggers CodePipeline for the deployment pipeline (staging, approval, production).

## Recommendation

**Choose GitHub Actions** when your team is GitHub-centric, you value developer experience and marketplace ecosystem, and your CI/CD needs are standard (test, build, deploy with some ML steps).

**Choose CodePipeline** when you need deep AWS integration, your pipelines involve many AWS services, you prefer console-based pipeline management, or your organization has strict AWS-only policies.

**Choose both** when you want the best of each: GitHub Actions for developer-facing CI on pull requests, CodePipeline for AWS-centric deployment to staging and production.
