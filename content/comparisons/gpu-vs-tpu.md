The choice between GPUs and TPUs affects training speed, inference latency, cost, and which frameworks and model architectures are practical to use. GPUs are the default for most AI workloads, but TPUs offer advantages for specific use cases, particularly large-scale training of transformer models on Google Cloud. This comparison covers the trade-offs for AI training and inference workloads.

## Hardware Overview

**GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)** are general-purpose parallel processors originally designed for graphics rendering. NVIDIA dominates the AI GPU market with the A100, H100, and H200 series. AMD competes with the MI300X. GPUs excel at matrix multiplication and are programmable through CUDA (NVIDIA) or ROCm (AMD).

**TPUs (Tensor Processing Units)** are Google's custom-designed ASICs optimized specifically for tensor operations in neural network workloads. TPUs are available exclusively through Google Cloud as Cloud TPU VMs or through Google's TPU Research Cloud. The current generation is TPU v5p for training and TPU v5e for inference.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | GPU (NVIDIA H100) | TPU (v5p) |
|---|---|---|
| Architecture | General-purpose parallel | Custom ASIC for tensors |
| Memory | 80GB HBM3 | 95GB HBM2e per chip |
| Memory bandwidth | 3.35 TB/s | 2.76 TB/s per chip |
| Interconnect | NVLink, NVSwitch, InfiniBand | ICI (Inter-Chip Interconnect) |
| Precision support | FP64, FP32, TF32, FP16, BF16, FP8, INT8 | BF16, FP32 (limited), INT8 |
| Programming | CUDA, cuDNN, TensorRT | XLA compiler (JAX, TensorFlow) |
| Framework support | PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, all major frameworks | JAX (best), TensorFlow, PyTorch/XLA |
| Cloud availability | AWS, GCP, Azure, Oracle, many others | GCP only |
| On-premises | Yes (purchased or leased) | No (cloud only) |
| Max cluster size | 256+ GPUs (depends on provider) | 8,960 chips (TPU v5p pod) |

## Training Performance

### Large Language Models

TPUs are optimized for transformer training at scale. Google's own large models (PaLM, Gemini) are trained on TPU pods. The TPU v5p pod provides up to 8,960 chips connected by a high-bandwidth ICI fabric, enabling efficient distributed training without the networking bottlenecks that plague GPU clusters at similar scale.

GPUs are the standard for LLM training outside Google. The NVIDIA H100 with NVLink and NVSwitch provides excellent single-node performance (8 GPUs per node), and InfiniBand networking scales to thousands of GPUs. Most open-source LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, Falcon) were trained on NVIDIA GPUs.

### Computer Vision

Both GPUs and TPUs handle CNN and ViT training well. GPUs have a slight edge for smaller models and batch sizes because of their lower overhead and more flexible memory management. TPUs perform better for large-batch training of vision transformers.

### Cost Efficiency

Cost comparisons are workload-specific. General guidelines:

- **Small to medium models (under 1B parameters):** GPUs are typically more cost-effective because TPU overhead (XLA compilation, pod setup) does not amortize over short training runs.
- **Large models (1B+ parameters):** TPUs become competitive because the ICI interconnect reduces communication overhead that adds cost on GPU clusters. Google also offers TPU pricing that undercuts equivalent GPU pricing for sustained training workloads.
- **Spot/preemptible instances:** Both GPU (AWS Spot, GCP Preemptible) and TPU (Preemptible TPU) offer 60-70% discounts. Checkpoint-and-resume strategies work with both.

## Inference Performance

### Latency

GPUs with TensorRT optimization achieve the lowest single-request latency for most model architectures. NVIDIA's inference stack (TensorRT, Triton Inference Server) is mature and highly optimized. TPU inference is competitive for transformer models but has higher cold-start latency due to XLA compilation.

### Throughput

TPUs are designed for high-throughput inference. For serving millions of predictions per day with a consistent model, TPU pods deliver high throughput at lower cost per prediction than equivalent GPU deployments. Google Search and other Google services use TPUs for production inference at massive scale.

### Model Compatibility

GPUs support every model format and framework. Any model that trains on GPUs can be served on GPUs with minimal changes.

TPUs require models to be compiled through XLA. JAX models work natively. TensorFlow models work well. PyTorch models require PyTorch/XLA, which supports most operations but has compatibility gaps for custom CUDA kernels and some dynamic operations. If your model uses custom CUDA kernels, TPU is not an option without rewriting those kernels.

## Ecosystem and Tooling

**GPU ecosystem** is vast. CUDA has a 15+ year head start. Libraries like cuDNN, cuBLAS, NCCL, TensorRT, and FlashAttention are GPU-specific and highly optimized. Most ML research is developed and benchmarked on NVIDIA GPUs. Debugging tools (Nsight, nvprof), profiling, and optimization guides are extensive.

**TPU ecosystem** is narrower but deep for its target workloads. JAX + TPU is a first-class combination with excellent performance. Google's Pathways infrastructure manages multi-TPU pod training. The TPU profiler in TensorBoard provides detailed performance analysis. However, community resources, tutorials, and third-party tools are fewer than for GPUs.

## When to Choose GPUs

- PyTorch is the primary framework
- Models use custom CUDA kernels or GPU-specific optimizations
- Multi-cloud or on-premises deployment is required
- Diverse workload types (training, inference, preprocessing) on the same hardware
- Small to medium scale training (under 64 accelerators)
- Need for the broadest framework and tool compatibility

## When to Choose TPUs

- Large-scale transformer training (1B+ parameters)
- JAX or TensorFlow is the primary framework
- Google Cloud is the primary cloud provider
- High-throughput inference for transformer models at scale
- Cost optimization for sustained, large-scale training runs
- Access to the largest single-cluster configurations (TPU pods)

## Hybrid Strategies

Some organizations use both: TPUs for large-scale training on GCP and GPUs for inference (deployed on the cloud provider closest to users) and for experimentation (where GPU flexibility and ecosystem breadth matter). This requires maintaining model export pipelines that convert between TPU-optimized and GPU-optimized formats, adding operational complexity but combining the strengths of both platforms.
