AWS and Google Cloud have the two most comprehensive AI service portfolios in the industry. Google's advantage is deep AI research (the transformer paper, BERT, AlphaFold originated from Google), while AWS leads on enterprise integration and service breadth. This article maps services between the two platforms.

## Foundation Models and LLM Access

| AWS | GCP | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) | [Vertex AI Model Garden](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-garden/explore-models) | Both provide access to multiple model families. Vertex offers Gemini (Google's flagship), Llama, and Mistral. Bedrock offers Claude, Llama, Mistral, Cohere, and Amazon Titan. |
| [Bedrock Agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) | [Vertex AI Agent Builder](https://cloud.google.com/products/agent-builder) | Managed agent frameworks. Vertex Agent Builder includes grounding with Google Search as a built-in capability. |
| [Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) | [Vertex AI Search / RAG Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/rag-overview) | Managed RAG pipelines. Vertex AI Search integrates Google's search quality into enterprise applications. |
| [Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) | [Vertex AI Safety Filters](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/responsible-ai) | Safety and content controls for model outputs. |

Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro / 2.0 models are strong competitors to Claude 3.5/4.x models on Bedrock. Gemini's 2M token context window exceeds what is available via Bedrock. For teams not locked into AWS, Vertex AI is a credible alternative.

## Speech and Language

| AWS | GCP | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Google Speech-to-Text](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/basics) | GCP's Chirp model offers strong multilingual transcription. AWS Transcribe Medical is specialized for healthcare. |
| [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Google Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/basics) | GCP's Neural2 and Chirp HD voices are high quality. GCP supports more languages. |
| [Amazon Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Cloud Translation API](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/overview) | Both support 70+ languages with neural MT. GCP's AutoML Translation allows domain customization. |
| [Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/basics) | Entity extraction, sentiment, syntax. GCP's Healthcare NL API specializes in clinical text. |

## Vision

| AWS | GCP | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Cloud Vision AI](https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/basics) | Both handle label detection, face analysis, OCR, explicit content detection. GCP Vision API has a strong history as Google's own image analysis infrastructure. |
| [Amazon Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Document AI](https://cloud.google.com/document-ai/docs/overview) | GCP Document AI has strong pre-built processors (invoice, receipt, form, ID). Both handle complex table extraction. |
| [Rekognition Video](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/video.html) | [Video Intelligence API](https://cloud.google.com/video-intelligence/docs/basics) | Video label detection, shot change, object tracking. GCP adds explicit content detection in video. |
| [Rekognition Custom Labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/what-is.html) | [AutoML Vision](https://cloud.google.com/vision/automl/docs) | Train custom image classifiers and object detectors. |

## ML Platform

| AWS | GCP | Notes |

## Decision Factors

**Choose AWS when:**
- Existing infrastructure is AWS-native
- You need Anthropic Claude models specifically (via Bedrock)
- Deep integration with AWS data services (Glue, Redshift, Kinesis) matters
- Enterprise procurement through AWS Marketplace is preferred

**Choose GCP when:**
- You need Gemini models or Google Search grounding
- The team uses Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Drive integration)
- BigQuery is your primary data warehouse
- You want access to Google's TPU infrastructure for custom model training
