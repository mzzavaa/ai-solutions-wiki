FastAPI and Flask are the two most popular Python web frameworks for building AI APIs. Most AI model serving, LLM orchestration, and ML pipeline APIs are built with one of them. This comparison focuses on AI-specific considerations.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | FastAPI | Flask |
|---|---|---|
| Async support | Native (built on ASGI) | Limited (via extensions) |
| Performance | High (async, Starlette) | Moderate (sync by default) |
| Type validation | Built-in (Pydantic) | Manual or via extensions |
| Auto-documentation | Automatic OpenAPI/Swagger | Manual or via Flask-RESTX |
| Learning curve | Moderate | Low |
| Ecosystem | Growing | Massive |
| WebSocket support | Built-in | Via Flask-SocketIO |
| Streaming responses | Built-in (StreamingResponse) | Possible but less ergonomic |

## AI-Specific Considerations

### LLM Response Streaming

LLM applications need to stream responses token by token:

**FastAPI** supports streaming natively via StreamingResponse. Combined with async generators, it handles token-by-token streaming elegantly. Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming are straightforward to implement.

**Flask** can stream responses using generators, but the implementation is less clean. Flask's synchronous nature can block during streaming. Extensions like flask-sse help but add complexity.

**Advantage:** FastAPI for streaming AI responses

### Async API Calls

AI applications make many external API calls (LLM providers, vector databases, feature stores). Async handling is important:

**FastAPI** endpoints are async by default. Multiple concurrent LLM API calls execute simultaneously, not sequentially. This significantly improves throughput for applications that orchestrate multiple AI service calls.

**Flask** is synchronous by default. Concurrent API calls require threading (via concurrent.futures) or async extensions (via Quart, an async Flask alternative). Achievable but requires more code.

**Advantage:** FastAPI for applications making many external API calls

### Request/Response Validation

AI APIs have complex request and response schemas (nested objects, arrays of embeddings, structured model outputs):

**FastAPI** uses Pydantic models for automatic validation. Define the schema once; FastAPI validates inputs, generates documentation, and provides type hints. This is particularly valuable for AI APIs with complex schemas.

**Flask** requires manual validation or extensions (marshmallow, flask-pydantic). More code for the same result.

**Advantage:** FastAPI for type safety and validation

### Model Loading and Initialization

Both frameworks need to load ML models at startup:

**FastAPI** uses the lifespan context manager for startup/shutdown logic. Load models in the lifespan function; they persist across requests.

**Flask** uses before_first_request (deprecated in recent versions) or application factory patterns. Models are typically loaded at module level or in the app factory.

Both handle model loading adequately. The pattern is slightly different but neither is significantly better.

## Performance

FastAPI is faster than Flask for AI workloads:

**Throughput.** FastAPI handles more concurrent requests due to async processing. For AI applications that spend most of their time waiting for external API responses, this difference is significant (2-5x throughput improvement).

**Latency.** For individual requests, the framework overhead is negligible compared to LLM inference time. A 500ms LLM call dwarfs the 1-2ms framework overhead difference.

**Memory.** Both are lightweight. Model size dominates memory usage, not the framework.

For high-traffic AI APIs, FastAPI's async advantage matters. For low-traffic APIs, either performs adequately.

## Developer Experience

**Flask** has a lower learning curve. "Hello World" is five lines of code. The extension ecosystem is massive and mature. Most Python developers have Flask experience. Documentation and tutorials are abundant.

**FastAPI** has a moderate learning curve. Understanding async/await, Pydantic models, and dependency injection takes time. However, the resulting code is more structured and self-documenting. FastAPI's automatic API documentation (Swagger UI) is valuable for AI APIs consumed by frontend developers.

## Production Readiness

Both are production-ready with proper setup:

**FastAPI** is served with Uvicorn (ASGI server) or Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers. Health checks, middleware, and error handling are built in.

**Flask** is served with Gunicorn (WSGI server). Health checks require explicit implementation. Middleware and error handling are available via extensions.

Both deploy well in containers (Docker) and on AWS (ECS, Lambda, SageMaker).

## When to Choose FastAPI

- Building a new AI API from scratch
- Need streaming responses (LLM token streaming)
- Application makes many concurrent external API calls
- Want automatic API documentation
- Team is comfortable with modern Python (async/await, type hints)

## When to Choose Flask

- Extending an existing Flask application with AI capabilities
- Simple AI API with straightforward request/response patterns
- Team has extensive Flask experience and limited FastAPI experience
- Need a specific Flask extension that has no FastAPI equivalent
- Building a prototype where development speed matters most

## Recommendation

For new AI applications, FastAPI is the better default choice. Its async support, streaming capabilities, and automatic validation align well with AI API requirements. For existing Flask applications, there is no urgent need to migrate - Flask handles AI workloads adequately, and the migration cost is rarely justified by performance gains alone.
