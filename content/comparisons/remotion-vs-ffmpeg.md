Remotion and FFmpeg are frequently mentioned together in AI video pipeline discussions, but they solve fundamentally different problems. Understanding where each fits prevents misuse of both.

## What Each Tool Does

**Remotion** creates video from scratch using React components. You write TSX that describes what appears on screen at each frame. Remotion renders each frame by running your React component in headless Chrome, then encodes the frame sequence to video. The output is a video assembled from data and components, not from pre-existing footage.

**FFmpeg** processes existing video files. It transcodes formats, trims clips, concatenates files, overlays graphics, adjusts audio levels, extracts frames, and applies video filters. FFmpeg does not generate video from nothing - it transforms video that already exists.

They are complementary tools, not alternatives.

## Use Case Comparison

| Task | Remotion | FFmpeg |
|---|---|---|
| Generate a video from a template + data | Yes | No |
| Trim a specific segment from a recording | No | Yes |
| Add a text overlay to existing footage | Both (Remotion if re-rendering; FFmpeg for filter) | Yes |
| Concatenate highlight clips | No | Yes |
| Create animated title cards | Yes | Possible but complex |
| Convert MP4 to HLS for streaming | No | Yes |
| Sync narration audio to video | Both (depends on context) | Yes |
| Generate 1000 personalized videos from a template | Yes (Lambda parallel) | No |

## AI Pipeline Integration

A common AI media pipeline uses both:

1. **FFmpeg** extracts frames from raw footage for Rekognition analysis
2. Rekognition identifies highlight timestamps
3. **FFmpeg** trims the highlights and concatenates them
4. **Remotion** adds branded intro/outro, lower-thirds, and animated captions
5. **FFmpeg** final encode for delivery (adaptive bitrate)

Neither tool is superior - each handles the stages it was built for.

## Complexity and Learning Curve

**FFmpeg** has a steep learning curve due to complex command-line syntax, codec parameters, and filter graph notation. A command to overlay text with custom font, position, and timing looks like:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \
  "drawtext=text='Hello World':fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf:\
  fontsize=36:fontcolor=white:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=h-100:\
  enable='between(t,5,15)'" output.mp4
```

**Remotion** has a gentler learning curve for React developers. Positioning, animation, and timing use React conventions and TypeScript. However, Remotion requires a build step and Lambda setup that FFmpeg-on-Lambda does not.

## Performance

FFmpeg with `-c copy` (no re-encoding) is extremely fast - cutting and concatenating a 1-hour video takes seconds. When re-encoding is required, FFmpeg uses multi-threaded CPU processing efficiently.

Remotion renders at approximately real-time on a single CPU for simple compositions. Lambda rendering parallelizes this across many concurrent invocations. A 10-minute video with 120 concurrent Lambda functions renders in under 2 minutes.

## When to Choose One Over the Other

**Use Remotion when:**
- Creating video from data (news segments, product demos, personalized content)
- Your team writes React/TypeScript
- Template-driven video generation is the core use case
- You need complex animated typography or data visualizations in video

**Use FFmpeg when:**
- Processing uploaded or recorded footage
- Format conversion, transcoding, packaging for delivery
- Splicing AI-selected clips from existing video
- Lambda-based processing of shorter clips (under 15 minutes)
