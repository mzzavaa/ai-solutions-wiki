Feature stores solve the problem of computing, storing, and serving ML features consistently across training and inference. Feast and Tecton are the two leading options, representing the open-source and managed approaches respectively. The choice between them depends on your team's operational maturity and real-time requirements.

## Overview

| Aspect | Feast | Tecton |
|---|---|---|
| Licensing | Open source (Apache 2.0) | Proprietary SaaS |
| Hosting | Self-managed | Fully managed |
| Origin | Gojek/Google, now Linux Foundation | Founded by Feast creators |
| Real-time Features | Supported (requires setup) | Native, low-latency |
| Batch Features | Strong | Strong |
| Stream Features | Limited native support | Native Spark/Flink integration |
| Monitoring | Basic | Built-in feature monitoring |

## Architecture

Feast uses a registry-based architecture. You define feature views in Python, apply them to a registry, and Feast materializes features from your data sources into online and offline stores. The online store serves low-latency reads for inference. The offline store provides historical features for training. Feast supports multiple backends: Redis, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL for online; BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, and file-based stores for offline.

Tecton provides a fully managed feature platform. It handles compute, storage, serving, and monitoring as an integrated service. Feature definitions are written in a Tecton-specific Python SDK and deployed via a CLI. Tecton manages the infrastructure for batch, streaming, and real-time feature transformations.

## Feature Computation

Feast is primarily a feature serving layer, not a feature computation engine. You compute features externally (in Spark, dbt, or SQL) and register them with Feast. Feast then materializes and serves them. This means you need separate infrastructure for feature pipelines.

Tecton handles feature computation natively. You define transformations in Tecton's SDK, and the platform orchestrates the compute. Batch transformations run on Spark or Rift (Tecton's native engine). Stream transformations consume from Kafka or Kinesis. Real-time transformations compute at request time. This integrated approach reduces the number of systems you manage.

## Real-time Feature Serving

For batch features served online, both tools perform well. The gap appears with real-time and streaming features.

Feast can serve pre-computed features with low latency from Redis or DynamoDB. For features that must be computed at request time (e.g., "number of transactions in the last 5 minutes"), Feast requires you to build and manage the streaming pipeline yourself.

Tecton provides native real-time feature computation with sub-100ms latency. Streaming features are first-class citizens with built-in time-windowed aggregations. This is Tecton's primary differentiator for fraud detection, recommendation, and personalization use cases.

## Monitoring and Governance

Feast provides basic metadata tracking through its registry. Feature statistics, data quality monitoring, and drift detection require external tools.

Tecton includes built-in feature monitoring with data quality checks, freshness monitoring, and drift detection. Access controls, audit logs, and feature lineage are part of the platform.

## When to Choose Feast

Choose Feast when your features are primarily batch-computed and your team has the engineering capacity to manage infrastructure. Feast works well when you want to avoid vendor lock-in, when your feature pipelines already exist in Spark or dbt, and when you need flexibility in choosing storage backends. Startups and teams with strong infrastructure skills can build effective feature platforms on Feast.

## When to Choose Tecton

Choose Tecton when real-time and streaming features are critical to your use cases. Fraud detection, real-time personalization, and dynamic pricing all benefit from Tecton's native streaming support. Teams that want a managed service and can absorb the cost should consider Tecton. Organizations that need built-in monitoring and governance without assembling it from separate tools also benefit.

## Practical Recommendation

If your feature needs are primarily batch (daily or hourly refreshes) and your team is comfortable managing infrastructure, Feast delivers significant value at no licensing cost. If you need sub-second feature freshness and want to minimize operational burden, Tecton's managed platform justifies the investment. Many organizations start with Feast for batch features and evaluate Tecton when real-time requirements emerge.
