Multi-agent systems use multiple LLM-powered agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. AutoGen (from Microsoft Research) and CrewAI are the two most popular frameworks for building these systems. They differ in abstraction level, conversation patterns, and how much control they give you over agent interactions.

## Overview

| Aspect | AutoGen | CrewAI |
|---|---|---|
| Origin | Microsoft Research | Open-source community |
| Abstraction Level | Lower-level, flexible | Higher-level, opinionated |
| Conversation Model | Agent-to-agent chat | Task-based crew execution |
| Role Definition | Code-defined behaviors | Role-playing with backstory |
| Human-in-the-loop | First-class support | Supported |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Gentler |
| Customization | Very high | Moderate |

## Architecture

AutoGen organizes agents around conversational patterns. Agents send messages to each other in defined topologies: two-agent chat, group chat, nested chat, or sequential chat. Each agent can have custom system messages, code execution capabilities, and tool access. The framework gives you fine-grained control over message routing and termination conditions.

CrewAI uses a task-oriented metaphor. You define a Crew with Agents (each having a role, goal, and backstory), Tasks (work items with descriptions and expected outputs), and a Process (sequential or hierarchical). The framework manages the conversation flow between agents based on task dependencies. This higher-level abstraction makes simple multi-agent workflows easy to build.

## Agent Definition

AutoGen agents are defined primarily through system messages and capabilities. A ConversableAgent can have a system message, LLM config, code executor, and tool functions. The agent's behavior emerges from these components.

CrewAI agents are defined through role-playing attributes: role, goal, backstory, and tools. The backstory field encourages you to create a detailed persona that guides the agent's behavior. This narrative approach can produce more consistent role adherence but can feel imprecise compared to explicit behavioral specifications.

## Orchestration

AutoGen provides multiple orchestration patterns. Two-agent chat is the simplest - agents converse until a termination condition. Group chat puts multiple agents in a shared conversation with configurable speaker selection (round-robin, random, or LLM-selected). Sequential chat chains multiple two-agent conversations. Nested chat allows an agent to spawn sub-conversations.

CrewAI offers two process types. Sequential processes execute tasks in order, passing output from one task as context to the next. Hierarchical processes add a manager agent that delegates tasks and synthesizes results. The hierarchical mode is useful for complex workflows but adds latency from the management layer.

## Tool Use

Both frameworks support tool integration, but the mechanisms differ. AutoGen uses function registration - you register Python functions that agents can call. AutoGen's tool use integrates with OpenAI-style function calling.

CrewAI provides a Tool abstraction with built-in tools for web search, file operations, and API calls. Custom tools extend a BaseTool class. CrewAI also supports LangChain tools directly, which expands the available tool ecosystem.

## Code Execution

AutoGen has strong built-in support for code execution through its CodeExecutor components. Agents can write code, execute it in Docker containers or local processes, and iterate on results. This makes AutoGen well-suited for coding tasks, data analysis, and automated experimentation.

CrewAI supports code execution through its CodeInterpreterTool but treats it as one tool among many rather than a core capability. For code-heavy workflows, AutoGen has a significant advantage.

## When to Choose AutoGen

Choose AutoGen when you need fine-grained control over agent conversations, when code execution is central to your use case, or when you need complex conversation topologies beyond simple sequential workflows. AutoGen is also the better choice for research and experimentation with novel agent architectures.

## When to Choose CrewAI

Choose CrewAI when you want to build multi-agent workflows quickly with minimal boilerplate. CrewAI's higher-level abstractions make it easier to prototype agent teams for content generation, research, analysis, and planning tasks. Teams that prefer declarative role definitions over imperative conversation management will find CrewAI more intuitive.

## Practical Recommendation

Start with CrewAI if your use case fits the crew-and-tasks metaphor - most business automation workflows do. Move to AutoGen when you need conversation patterns that CrewAI's process types cannot express, when code execution is a primary capability, or when you need to customize agent behavior at a lower level. Both frameworks are evolving rapidly, so evaluate against current versions rather than documentation that may be outdated.
