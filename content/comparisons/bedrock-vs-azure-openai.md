Both Amazon Bedrock and Azure OpenAI Service provide enterprise-grade access to large language models through managed cloud APIs. The right choice depends on your existing cloud footprint, compliance requirements, which models you need, and your integration architecture. This comparison focuses on practical factors that matter at the point of decision.

## Model Selection

**Azure OpenAI** provides access to OpenAI's model family: GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and the o1 reasoning model series. If your requirements include OpenAI's specific models - for example, because you are building on a framework that expects OpenAI's API format, or because evaluation shows GPT-4o performs better for your specific task - Azure OpenAI is the path to those models in an enterprise deployment.

**Amazon Bedrock** provides model variety: Anthropic Claude (the strongest alternative to GPT-4 class models), Meta Llama, Mistral, Cohere, and Amazon Titan. This multi-provider access is a meaningful advantage when: you want to choose the best model per task, you want pricing leverage, or you have concerns about vendor concentration risk in your AI stack.

Summary: if you need OpenAI models specifically, use Azure OpenAI. If you want optionality, including Claude (which outperforms GPT-4o on several benchmark tasks and is preferred for document-heavy workflows), Bedrock provides more choice.

## Enterprise Features

**Compliance and data handling** - Both services offer private deployment options where your data is not used for model training. Both support deployment in specific regions for data residency. Azure OpenAI offers Azure Government cloud for US government compliance (FedRAMP High). Bedrock has AWS GovCloud for equivalent US government requirements. For European deployments, both offer EU-region options; Mistral models on Bedrock have an additional European provenance argument.

**Security and access control** - Bedrock uses IAM natively, which integrates seamlessly with existing AWS access control, VPC configurations, and CloudTrail audit logging. Azure OpenAI integrates with Azure Active Directory and Azure's RBAC model. If your organization is deeply committed to one cloud provider's security model, its native service is lower friction to govern.

**Guardrails and safety controls** - Bedrock's Guardrails feature is more configurable than Azure's built-in content filtering, particularly for custom topic restrictions and grounding checks. Azure's content filters cover standard harmful content categories but offer less domain-specific customization.

## Pricing

Pricing for both services is per-token and changes frequently - check current pricing pages for exact numbers. At the time of writing, comparable quality tiers are approximately price-equivalent between Claude on Bedrock and GPT-4 class models on Azure OpenAI. Llama and Mistral models on Bedrock offer significantly lower cost for tasks where they are sufficient, which Azure OpenAI cannot match (OpenAI does not license those models to Azure).

## Integration Architecture

**If you are primarily AWS-native** - Bedrock is the obvious choice. Lambda, Step Functions, S3, Cognito, and every other AWS service integrate with Bedrock through IAM. Adding Azure OpenAI to an AWS-native stack introduces a cross-cloud dependency that complicates networking, adds latency, and requires additional credential management.

**If you are primarily Azure-native** - Azure OpenAI is lower friction for the same reasons in reverse. Azure Functions, Logic Apps, and the Microsoft 365 ecosystem are designed to integrate with Azure OpenAI.

**Hybrid approaches** - Some organizations use both: Azure OpenAI for integration with Microsoft productivity tools (Copilot, Teams, SharePoint) and Bedrock for custom application development on AWS. This is a legitimate architecture when the use cases are distinct, and it avoids forcing one cloud's AI services into the other's application stack.

## Recommendation

Default to the AI service from the cloud provider you are already using. The integration, security, and operational benefits of staying within one provider's ecosystem are substantial. Deviate from that default when a specific model requirement, compliance constraint, or cost factor makes the cross-cloud approach clearly worth the overhead.
