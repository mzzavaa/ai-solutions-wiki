Both AWS and Azure provide comprehensive governance tooling. This comparison covers the key capabilities relevant to AI workloads and helps organizations understand the strengths of each platform's governance approach.

## Organization and Account Management

**AWS** uses AWS Organizations with Organizational Units (OUs) and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to manage multi-account environments. SCPs act as permission guardrails that restrict what actions are available in member accounts. AWS Control Tower provides a pre-configured landing zone with baseline governance controls.

**Azure** uses Management Groups, Subscriptions, and Resource Groups in a hierarchy. Azure Policy assigns and enforces rules at any level of the hierarchy. Azure Landing Zones provide reference architecture with pre-built governance.

**Verdict:** Both are mature. AWS SCPs are simpler (deny-only), while Azure Policy supports both deny and deploy-if-not-exists effects, enabling automatic remediation.

## Policy Enforcement

**AWS** combines SCPs (preventive guardrails at the organization level), AWS Config rules (detective controls monitoring resource compliance), and CloudFormation Guard / CDK Nag (shift-left policy checks in IaC). Config rules can trigger automated remediation via Systems Manager.

**Azure** uses Azure Policy for both preventive (deny deployments that violate rules) and detective (audit non-compliant resources) controls. Policy initiatives group related policies. Azure Policy supports custom policies using Rego (OPA).

**Verdict:** Azure Policy is more flexible with its built-in remediation tasks and broader effect types. AWS requires combining multiple services to achieve equivalent functionality.

## Cost Governance

**AWS** provides Cost Explorer, Budgets, Cost Anomaly Detection, and the Cost and Usage Report. SageMaker-specific cost visibility is available through resource tagging. Savings Plans and Reserved Instances cover ML compute.

**Azure** offers Cost Management + Billing with similar budgeting and anomaly detection. Azure Advisor provides optimization recommendations. Azure Reservations cover ML compute.

**Verdict:** Comparable capabilities. Both require disciplined tagging to attribute AI workload costs accurately.

## Security Monitoring

**AWS** offers Security Hub (aggregated findings), GuardDuty (threat detection), Inspector (vulnerability scanning), Macie (sensitive data discovery), and CloudTrail (audit logging). AI-specific monitoring through SageMaker Model Monitor and Bedrock invocation logging.

**Azure** provides Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CSPM and threat protection), Sentinel (SIEM), Purview (data governance and classification), and Azure Monitor. AI-specific monitoring through Azure AI Studio monitoring and Content Safety.

**Verdict:** Azure Defender for Cloud provides a more unified CSPM experience. AWS requires combining more services but offers deeper per-service capabilities.

## AI-Specific Governance

**AWS** manages foundation model access through Bedrock with model access controls. SageMaker provides model registry, experiment tracking, and model cards. SageMaker Role Manager helps create least-privilege roles for ML personas.

**Azure** provides Azure AI Studio as a centralized platform with built-in content safety, model catalog access controls, and evaluation tools. Azure Machine Learning includes model registry and responsible AI dashboard.

**Verdict:** Azure AI Studio provides a more integrated governance experience for AI. AWS offers more granular control but requires more assembly.

## Recommendation

For organizations already invested in one cloud, extend governance to AI workloads using native tools. For multi-cloud environments, consider third-party governance platforms (Wiz, Prisma Cloud) that provide consistent policy enforcement across both clouds. Regardless of platform, the fundamentals are the same: enforce tagging, restrict regions, apply least privilege, encrypt everything, and monitor continuously.
