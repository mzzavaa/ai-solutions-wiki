CrewAI and LangGraph both enable multi-agent AI systems but take fundamentally different approaches to how agents are organized, how state flows between them, and how much control you have over execution. The right choice depends on whether your workflow fits a role-based collaboration model or a graph-based state machine model.

## Core Architecture Difference

**CrewAI** organizes agents around roles and tasks. You define agents with descriptions of who they are (a "Senior Research Analyst" or "Claims Processing Specialist"), what tools they have access to, and what their goal is. You then define tasks and assign them to agents. The framework handles the coordination: agents collaborate in a defined sequence (sequential process) or can delegate to each other (hierarchical process).

**LangGraph** organizes agents around a state graph. You define nodes (functions or agent calls) and edges (transitions between nodes). State is an explicit data structure that flows through the graph and can be inspected or modified at any node. Execution follows the graph topology, with conditional edges enabling branching based on state values.

## When CrewAI Fits Better

CrewAI works well when:

- Your workflow maps naturally to a team of specialists working on a complex task
- You want agents to be able to delegate to each other dynamically
- You are prototyping and want to get something working quickly
- The task requires agents with different personas that use different prompting strategies

The role-based model is intuitive for knowledge work scenarios: research tasks, content creation, analysis pipelines where different expertise contributes to a common output.

CrewAI's limitation is control. The framework handles coordination, which means you have less visibility into why an agent made a particular choice or took a particular path. Debugging complex failures is harder.

## When LangGraph Fits Better

LangGraph works well when:

- Your workflow is a defined process with conditional branching
- You need explicit control over state at every step
- The workflow must be auditable - every state transition and decision needs to be logged
- You are building something that will run in production and needs to be debugged and monitored

The graph model is more complex to design than CrewAI's role model, but it gives you full visibility into what is happening at every step. Regulated workflows - insurance claims, financial approvals, government intake - typically require this level of auditability.

LangGraph's state persistence is a significant advantage for long-running workflows: you can pause a workflow, resume it after human review, and restart from any checkpoint. This is essential for human-in-the-loop implementations.

## Complexity Trade-offs

CrewAI requires less upfront design. Define your agents and tasks, and the framework figures out coordination. This is faster to get started but can be unpredictable at the edges.

LangGraph requires you to design the state schema and the full graph topology before you can build. This is more work upfront but produces a system whose behavior is defined by your design, not by framework heuristics.

A rough heuristic: if your workflow has fewer than 5 steps and the coordination is genuinely flexible, CrewAI is faster to build. If your workflow has well-defined steps, conditional branches, or auditability requirements, LangGraph's design overhead pays off.

## AWS Integration

Both frameworks can be used with Amazon Bedrock as the underlying LLM provider. Bedrock's Converse API is compatible with both.

LangGraph integrates naturally with Step Functions for orchestration and checkpointing - you can run LangGraph within a Lambda function invoked by Step Functions and store state in DynamoDB between invocations. This is a production-grade pattern for long-running agentic workflows.

CrewAI on AWS typically runs as a container on ECS or a long-running Lambda (if within timeout limits). It does not have native AWS state persistence, so long-running or resumable workflows require additional implementation work.

## Summary

Use CrewAI for flexible, role-based workflows where iteration speed matters and the workflow does not require strict auditability. Use LangGraph for production workflows where you need precise control over state, conditional execution, human-in-the-loop gates, and complete observability.
