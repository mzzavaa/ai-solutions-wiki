AI applications expose APIs for model inference, data retrieval, and system management. REST and GraphQL represent different approaches to API design. For AI workloads, the choice is influenced by streaming requirements, query complexity, and client diversity.

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | REST | GraphQL |
|---|---|---|
| Data fetching | Multiple endpoints, fixed responses | Single endpoint, client-specified fields |
| Over-fetching | Common (fixed response shape) | Eliminated (request only needed fields) |
| Under-fetching | Requires multiple requests | Single request for nested data |
| Streaming | SSE, WebSocket (well-supported) | Subscriptions (less mature for LLM streaming) |
| Caching | HTTP caching (simple, well-understood) | Complex (query-based, needs client library) |
| File upload | Native support | Requires multipart spec extension |
| Learning curve | Low | Moderate |
| Tooling maturity | Very mature | Mature but less universal |

## AI-Specific Considerations

### LLM Streaming

LLM applications need token-by-token streaming. This is the most critical API design consideration:

**REST** handles streaming naturally via Server-Sent Events (SSE). The client makes a POST request and receives a stream of events, each containing a token or chunk. This is the standard approach used by OpenAI, Anthropic, and most LLM APIs. Well-supported by all HTTP clients and frameworks.

**GraphQL** supports streaming via Subscriptions (WebSocket-based). However, LLM streaming over GraphQL subscriptions is less standard. Most LLM provider SDKs use REST-based streaming. Using GraphQL for LLM streaming adds complexity without clear benefit.

**Winner:** REST for LLM streaming

### RAG Query APIs

RAG systems need to retrieve documents, generate responses, and return both the response and the source documents:

**REST approach:** GET /search?query=... returns documents. POST /chat sends the query and documents to the LLM. Two requests, two response schemas.

**GraphQL approach:** A single query can request the chat response, source documents, confidence scores, and metadata in one request. The client specifies exactly what it needs.

```graphql
query {
  chat(message: "What is our refund policy?") {
    response
    sources { title url relevanceScore }
    confidence
    tokensUsed
  }
}
```

**Winner:** GraphQL for complex query results; REST for simple inference

### Model Management APIs

APIs for managing models (list models, deploy, check status, view metrics):

**REST:** CRUD operations on model resources. GET /models, POST /models/{id}/deploy, GET /models/{id}/metrics. Clear, predictable, well-suited to resource management.

**GraphQL:** Query multiple related resources in one request. Get a model with its deployment status, latest metrics, and recent predictions in a single query. Useful for dashboard applications that need diverse data.

**Winner:** REST for simple CRUD; GraphQL for dashboards needing multiple related resources

### Batch Inference APIs

Sending many items for inference in a single request:

**REST:** POST /inference/batch with an array of inputs. Simple and efficient.

**GraphQL:** Can handle batch queries but the schema can become complex for variable-size batches.

**Winner:** REST for batch inference

## Caching

**REST** benefits from HTTP caching natively. GET requests for model metadata, document search results, and configuration data are cacheable with standard HTTP headers (Cache-Control, ETag). CDNs and reverse proxies cache REST responses transparently.

**GraphQL** uses POST for all requests (including reads), which bypasses HTTP caching. Client-side caching requires GraphQL-specific libraries (Apollo Client, urql) with normalized caching. More complex but more precise.

For AI applications where inference results should not be cached (they depend on model version, time, and context), caching differences are less important. For read-heavy workloads (model catalog, documentation, configuration), REST's caching advantage is significant.

## Client Diversity

**REST** is universally supported. Every programming language, every HTTP client, every platform can call REST APIs. AI inference APIs called by mobile apps, backend services, CLI tools, and other systems benefit from REST's universality.

**GraphQL** requires a GraphQL client or at minimum understanding of the query language. While GraphQL clients are available for major languages, the ecosystem is smaller than REST.

For AI APIs consumed by diverse clients (internal services, third-party integrations, mobile apps), REST's universality is an advantage.

## Performance

**REST** has lower overhead per request. No query parsing step. HTTP/2 multiplexing handles multiple concurrent requests efficiently.

**GraphQL** adds query parsing and validation overhead per request. For simple queries, this overhead is measurable. For complex queries that would otherwise require multiple REST calls, the reduction in network round-trips compensates.

For AI inference requests (where the model execution time dominates), the API layer overhead is negligible regardless of choice.

## When to Choose REST

- Building LLM inference APIs with streaming
- APIs consumed by diverse clients
- Simple request/response patterns (input in, prediction out)
- Team is experienced with REST
- Need standard HTTP caching
- Building APIs that follow LLM provider conventions (OpenAI-compatible APIs)

## When to Choose GraphQL

- Building a complex AI dashboard that queries multiple data sources
- Clients need flexibility in what data they request
- Multiple frontend applications with different data needs from the same backend
- The data model is complex with many relationships (models, experiments, datasets, metrics)
- Reducing the number of API round-trips is important for client performance

## Practical Recommendation

For most AI applications, REST is the better default. LLM streaming is naturally REST-based, the ecosystem is more mature, and the simplicity reduces development and maintenance effort. Consider GraphQL when building complex AI management dashboards or applications where clients have diverse data needs from a richly connected data model.

Many AI applications use both: REST for inference APIs (streaming, simple request/response) and GraphQL for management and dashboard APIs (complex queries, nested data).
