AI workloads have diverse storage needs: training datasets, model artifacts, checkpoint files, feature stores, and inference caches. S3 and EFS both store data on AWS but serve fundamentally different access patterns. Choosing the wrong one causes performance bottlenecks or unnecessary cost.

## Fundamental Differences

**Amazon S3** is object storage. You store and retrieve entire objects (files) via HTTP API. No filesystem semantics - no directories, no file locking, no random access within files. Virtually unlimited capacity. Extremely durable (99.999999999%).

**Amazon EFS** is a managed NFS filesystem. Mounted like a local filesystem on EC2, ECS, Lambda, and SageMaker. Standard filesystem operations: read, write, seek, list directories, file locking. Capacity grows and shrinks automatically.

## AI Training Data

### Large Datasets (100GB+)

**S3** is the standard choice. Training frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow) have native S3 data loading. SageMaker Training supports Pipe mode that streams data directly from S3 during training without downloading it first. S3 handles any dataset size.

**EFS** can store training data with POSIX filesystem access, which simplifies code that expects local file paths. However, EFS throughput is limited by provisioned throughput or burst credits. For large datasets, S3 is more cost-effective and performs better.

**Winner:** S3 for large datasets

### Small Datasets with Random Access

**S3** requires downloading entire objects. If your training code reads small portions of large files randomly (e.g., random access within HDF5 files), S3 is inefficient.

**EFS** supports random access within files, making it suitable for workloads that read small portions of large files. NFS caching improves repeated access patterns.

**Winner:** EFS for random access patterns

## Model Artifacts

### Model Storage and Versioning

**S3** is the standard for model artifact storage. S3 versioning tracks model versions. SageMaker Model Registry stores model artifacts in S3. Lifecycle policies move old versions to cheaper storage tiers.

**EFS** can store models but lacks built-in versioning. More expensive per GB than S3.

**Winner:** S3

### Model Loading for Inference

**S3** model loading requires downloading the model to the inference instance at startup. For large models (multi-GB), this can take minutes and contributes to cold start time.

**EFS** model loading is near-instant because the filesystem is already mounted. The model appears as a local file. For SageMaker endpoints and Lambda, EFS mounting eliminates the model download step.

**Winner:** EFS for fast model loading; S3 for long-running endpoints (download once)

## Checkpoint Storage

Training checkpoints must be written frequently and reliably:

**S3** checkpoint writing requires uploading the complete checkpoint file. For large checkpoints (multi-GB), the upload takes seconds to minutes. S3's durability ensures checkpoints are not lost.

**EFS** checkpoint writing is a standard file write operation. Faster for frequent, small checkpoints. The filesystem handles the write; no need for upload logic.

**Winner:** EFS for frequent checkpoints; S3 for durability

## Cost Comparison

| Storage Type | S3 Standard | S3 IA | EFS Standard | EFS IA |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storage $/GB/month | $0.023 | $0.0125 | $0.30 | $0.016 |
| Read cost | $0.0004/1000 requests | $0.001/1000 | Included in throughput | Included |
| Write cost | $0.005/1000 requests | $0.01/1000 | Included in throughput | Included |

EFS Standard is 13x more expensive per GB than S3 Standard. For large datasets (100GB+), this difference is significant. EFS Infrequent Access reduces the gap but adds access charges.

**Cost optimization:** Store large, infrequently accessed datasets in S3. Use EFS for data that needs filesystem access and is actively used. Use EFS lifecycle policies to move inactive data to EFS IA automatically.

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | S3 | EFS |
|---|---|---|
| Throughput | Virtually unlimited (parallelize requests) | Provisioned or burst (up to 10+ GB/s with provisioned) |
| Latency (first byte) | 50-100 ms | 0.5-2 ms (cached), 10-50 ms (uncached) |
| IOPS | 5,500+ PUT/sec per prefix | Thousands (depends on provisioning) |
| Random access | Not supported (full object read) | Supported (POSIX) |
| Concurrent access | Unlimited readers | Thousands of concurrent NFS clients |

S3 excels at parallel bulk reads. EFS excels at low-latency random access.

## Common Patterns for AI

### Pattern 1: S3 Primary (Most Common)

Store everything in S3. Training data, models, checkpoints, and datasets all in S3. Use framework-native S3 integration for data loading. This is the simplest and cheapest approach.

### Pattern 2: S3 + EFS Hybrid

S3 for bulk storage and archival. EFS mounted on compute instances for:
- Model loading (fast cold starts)
- Shared workspace for teams using notebooks
- Checkpoint storage during training
- Temporary processing storage

### Pattern 3: EFS for Shared Development

Data science teams share datasets and models via EFS. Each notebook instance mounts the same EFS filesystem. Changes are immediately visible to all team members.

## Recommendation

**Use S3** as the default for AI workloads. It handles most storage needs at the lowest cost. Use S3 for training datasets, model artifact storage, pipeline outputs, and long-term storage.

**Add EFS** when you need filesystem semantics: shared development environments, fast model loading for inference, frequent checkpoint writes during training, or workloads that require random file access.

**Avoid** storing large training datasets on EFS when S3 would work. The cost difference at scale is substantial and the performance difference for sequential reads is minimal.
