DynamoDB and OpenSearch serve different roles in AI applications, but their capabilities overlap in areas like vector search and metadata storage. Understanding where each excels prevents architectural mistakes.

## Core Strengths

**DynamoDB** is a fully managed NoSQL key-value and document database. Designed for single-digit millisecond latency at any scale. Excels at simple key-based lookups and writes with predictable performance.

**OpenSearch** is a managed search and analytics engine. Designed for full-text search, log analytics, and vector search. Excels at complex queries across many fields with relevance scoring.

## AI Application Use Cases

### Conversation History Storage

**DynamoDB:** Natural fit. Store conversations by session_id (partition key) and message_timestamp (sort key). Single-digit millisecond reads. Scales automatically. TTL for automatic expiration of old conversations.

**OpenSearch:** Overpowered for this use case. Adds unnecessary complexity and cost for simple key-based retrieval.

**Winner:** DynamoDB

### Vector Search (RAG)

**DynamoDB:** No native vector search support. Cannot perform similarity search on embeddings.

**OpenSearch:** Built-in k-NN (k-nearest neighbors) plugin supports approximate and exact vector search. HNSW and IVF indexing algorithms. Supports filtering alongside vector search.

**Winner:** OpenSearch

### Metadata Search and Filtering

**DynamoDB:** Limited query flexibility. Efficient for queries on partition key and sort key. Global secondary indexes support additional query patterns but with limitations. Complex filters are possible but expensive (scan operations).

**OpenSearch:** Excels at complex queries. Full-text search, range queries, aggregations, nested object queries, and faceted search are all native capabilities.

**Winner:** OpenSearch for complex queries; DynamoDB for simple key-based access

### User Profile and Session State

**DynamoDB:** Excellent fit. Key-value access pattern matches perfectly. Consistent low latency. On-demand capacity handles variable traffic.

**OpenSearch:** Unnecessary complexity for simple profile lookups.

**Winner:** DynamoDB

### Analytics and Aggregation

**DynamoDB:** Not designed for analytics. Aggregation queries require scanning the entire table or using DynamoDB Streams to feed data to an analytics system.

**OpenSearch:** Built for analytics. Aggregation framework supports complex analytics queries: histograms, percentiles, term aggregations, nested aggregations.

**Winner:** OpenSearch

## Comparison Table

| Feature | DynamoDB | OpenSearch |
|---|---|---|
| Read latency | Single-digit ms | 10-100 ms |
| Write latency | Single-digit ms | 10-50 ms |
| Vector search | No | Yes (k-NN plugin) |
| Full-text search | No | Yes |
| Complex queries | Limited | Extensive |
| Auto-scaling | Yes (on-demand mode) | Manual or auto-scaling policies |
| Managed service | Fully managed | Managed (OpenSearch Service) |
| Operational complexity | Very low | Moderate |
| Cost model | Per-request or provisioned capacity | Per-instance-hour |
| Max document size | 400 KB | No practical limit |

## Cost Comparison

**DynamoDB on-demand:** $1.25 per million write request units, $0.25 per million read request units. Storage: $0.25/GB/month. Excellent for variable workloads.

**DynamoDB provisioned:** Cheaper per-request for steady workloads. Reserved capacity available for additional savings.

**OpenSearch Service:** Instance-based pricing. A t3.medium.search instance costs ~$0.07/hour (~$50/month). Production deployments typically need 3+ instances for high availability. Minimum monthly cost: ~$150 for a basic HA setup.

For AI applications, the cost comparison depends on the access pattern:
- If you need vector search, you need OpenSearch (or another vector database). DynamoDB cannot substitute.
- If you need only key-value access (session state, user profiles), DynamoDB is simpler and often cheaper.
- If you need both, use both. This is the common pattern in AI applications.

## Common AI Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: DynamoDB + OpenSearch

The most common pattern for AI applications:
- DynamoDB stores conversation history, user sessions, and application state
- OpenSearch stores document embeddings and handles vector search for RAG
- Application queries DynamoDB for state and OpenSearch for retrieval

### Pattern 2: OpenSearch as Primary

For search-heavy applications:
- OpenSearch stores everything: documents, embeddings, metadata
- Used when the primary access pattern is search and retrieval
- Simpler architecture but higher operational complexity

### Pattern 3: DynamoDB as Primary

For simple AI applications:
- DynamoDB stores everything except vector search data
- LLM inference handled by Bedrock (no local vector search needed)
- Works when RAG is not required or when Bedrock Knowledge Bases handles retrieval

## Recommendation

Use DynamoDB for application state, session management, and simple key-value access patterns. Use OpenSearch for vector search, full-text search, complex queries, and analytics. Most production AI applications benefit from using both, each for its strength.
