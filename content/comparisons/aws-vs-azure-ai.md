AWS and Azure both offer comprehensive AI service portfolios. Teams evaluating or migrating between clouds need a clear service mapping. This article maps AWS AI services to their Azure equivalents across every major category.

## Foundation Models and LLM Access

| AWS | Azure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) | [Azure OpenAI Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) | Bedrock offers multi-vendor models (Claude, Llama, Mistral, Cohere, Titan). Azure OpenAI is primarily GPT-4/GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, with access to DALL-E and Whisper. |
| [Bedrock Agents](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/agents.html) | [Azure AI Agent Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/agents/overview) | Both provide managed agent runtimes with tool use. Azure AI Agent Service integrates with the Azure AI Foundry ecosystem. |
| [Bedrock Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) | [Azure AI Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-what-is-azure-search) | Both provide managed RAG infrastructure with vector search. |
| [Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) | [Azure AI Content Safety](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/content-safety/overview) | Content filtering and safety controls for LLM outputs. |

For multi-model flexibility, Bedrock has an advantage: access to Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, Cohere, and Amazon models from a single API. Azure OpenAI is primarily one vendor's models, though Azure AI Foundry is expanding this.

## Speech and Language

| AWS | Azure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Transcribe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/transcribe/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Speech - STT](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/speech-to-text) | Azure has broader language coverage (130+ vs 100+). AWS Transcribe Medical has strong healthcare-specific accuracy. |
| [Amazon Polly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Speech - TTS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/text-to-speech) | Azure has 400+ voices vs Polly's 60+. Azure's neural voice quality is consistently high across languages. |
| [Amazon Translate](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Translator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/translator/overview) | Both support 70+ languages with neural translation quality. Azure Translator integrates with Office 365 workflows. |
| [Amazon Comprehend](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Language Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview) | Sentiment, entity extraction, key phrase extraction. Azure adds opinion mining and healthcare NER via Language service. |
| [Amazon Lex](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Bot Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-overview) | Conversational AI for chatbots. Azure Bot Service integrates with Teams. |

## Vision

| AWS | Azure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon Rekognition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure AI Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/computer-vision/overview) | Label detection, face analysis, OCR, content moderation. Azure Vision adds spatial analysis for physical spaces. |
| [Amazon Textract](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/textract/latest/dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview) | Structured document extraction (forms, tables). Azure Document Intelligence has strong pre-built models for specific document types (invoices, receipts, IDs). |
| [Rekognition Custom Labels](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/what-is.html) | [Azure Custom Vision](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/custom-vision-service/overview) | Train vision models on your own labeled images. |

## ML Platform

| AWS | Azure | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Amazon SageMaker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/whatis.html) | [Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/overview-what-is-azure-machine-learning) | Full ML lifecycle platforms. SageMaker has deeper AWS service integration. Azure ML has strong MLflow support. |
| [SageMaker Ground Truth](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/sms.html) | [Azure ML Data Labeling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-create-image-labeling-projects) | Managed data labeling with human annotators. |
| [SageMaker Pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines.html) | [Azure ML Pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines) | ML workflow orchestration. |
| [Amazon Forecast](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/what-is-forecast.html) | [Azure AI Metrics Advisor](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/overview) | Time-series forecasting as a managed service. |

## Decision Factors

**Choose AWS when:**
- Your infrastructure is already AWS-native (Lambda, S3, Step Functions)
- You need multi-vendor model access through one API (Bedrock)
- Deep integration with S3 event pipelines matters
- You use AWS IAM for unified access control

**Choose Azure when:**
- Your organization uses Microsoft 365, Teams, or Azure Active Directory
- You want GPT-4 access with enterprise data privacy agreements
- Your team already manages Azure infrastructure
- You need Azure-specific compliance certifications (German government cloud, etc.)
