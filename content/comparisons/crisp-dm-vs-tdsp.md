Choosing a methodology for data science projects matters more than most teams realize. Without structure, data science work drifts into exploratory dead ends. CRISP-DM and Microsoft TDSP are the two most widely adopted frameworks. They share DNA but differ in important ways.

## Overview

| Aspect | CRISP-DM | Microsoft TDSP |
|---|---|---|
| Origin | IBM/NCR/SPSS consortium, 1996 | Microsoft, 2016 |
| Focus | Vendor-neutral data mining process | End-to-end data science lifecycle |
| Phases | 6 phases | 5 lifecycle stages |
| Team Guidance | Minimal | Detailed role definitions |
| Tooling Opinions | None | Azure-oriented but adaptable |
| Documentation Templates | None | Extensive templates provided |

## Phase Comparison

CRISP-DM defines six phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment. The process is explicitly iterative - arrows connect every phase to every other phase, acknowledging that data science work rarely proceeds linearly.

TDSP defines five stages: Business Understanding, Data Acquisition and Understanding, Modeling, Deployment, and Customer Acceptance. TDSP merges CRISP-DM's Data Understanding and Data Preparation into a single stage and adds an explicit Customer Acceptance stage that CRISP-DM lacks.

| CRISP-DM Phase | TDSP Equivalent | Key Difference |
|---|---|---|
| Business Understanding | Business Understanding | TDSP adds structured templates for defining success metrics |
| Data Understanding | Data Acquisition and Understanding | TDSP combines exploration and preparation |
| Data Preparation | Data Acquisition and Understanding | TDSP includes data pipeline guidance |
| Modeling | Modeling | TDSP adds feature engineering as explicit step |
| Evaluation | Customer Acceptance | TDSP frames evaluation from the customer perspective |
| Deployment | Deployment | TDSP includes CI/CD and MLOps guidance |

## Team Structure and Roles

This is where the frameworks diverge most significantly. CRISP-DM says almost nothing about team structure. It assumes someone will do the work but does not specify who or how teams should be organized.

TDSP defines four explicit roles: Group Manager, Team Lead, Project Lead, and Individual Contributor. Each role has defined responsibilities, and TDSP provides onboarding documentation for each. For organizations building their first data science team, this guidance is valuable. For mature teams with established roles, it can feel prescriptive.

## Tooling and Templates

CRISP-DM is deliberately tool-agnostic. This is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. Teams can apply CRISP-DM with any technology stack, but they get no starter templates, no repository structures, and no automation guidance.

TDSP ships with a standardized project structure for Git repositories, document templates for each phase, and utilities for data exploration. While originally designed around Azure Machine Learning, the templates work with any platform. The TDSP project template on GitHub includes directories for code, data, docs, and sample reports.

## When to Choose CRISP-DM

CRISP-DM works best when your team already has established processes and needs a lightweight conceptual framework rather than prescriptive guidance. It is also the better choice when you need a vendor-neutral methodology that does not imply any particular cloud platform. Academic research projects, cross-platform consulting engagements, and experienced data science teams benefit from CRISP-DM's flexibility.

## When to Choose TDSP

TDSP is the stronger choice for teams that need structure. If you are building a data science practice from scratch, TDSP's role definitions, templates, and repository structures save months of process design. Teams already invested in the Azure ecosystem get native integration. Organizations that need to standardize across multiple data science teams also benefit from TDSP's opinionated structure.

## Practical Recommendation

Many teams use both. CRISP-DM provides the mental model for how data science projects flow. TDSP provides the operational scaffolding for how to run them. Start with TDSP's templates and repository structure, but use CRISP-DM's iterative phase model to set expectations with stakeholders that data science work does not proceed in a straight line from requirements to deployment.

The biggest risk with either methodology is treating it as waterfall. Both frameworks emphasize iteration, but project managers accustomed to linear delivery often flatten the phases into sequential gates. Resist this. The value of both frameworks is in acknowledging that you will revisit earlier phases as you learn from data.
