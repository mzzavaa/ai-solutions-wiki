The on-premise vs cloud decision for AI workloads involves trade-offs between control, cost, scalability, and capability. AI workloads have specific characteristics (GPU dependency, variable compute demand, rapid technology evolution) that shift the calculation compared to traditional workloads.

## Comparison Table

| Factor | On-Premise | Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| GPU availability | Purchase and maintain | On-demand, latest hardware |
| Upfront cost | High (hardware, facilities, setup) | Low (pay as you go) |
| Ongoing cost | Fixed (depreciation, power, cooling, staff) | Variable (usage-based) |
| Scalability | Limited by physical capacity | Virtually unlimited |
| Latest hardware | Procurement cycle (months) | Available immediately |
| Data sovereignty | Full control | Cloud regions, compliance certifications |
| Managed AI services | Not available | Bedrock, SageMaker, AI APIs |
| Operational staff | Required (hardware, networking, security) | Reduced (cloud manages infrastructure) |
| Time to start | Weeks to months | Minutes |
| Technology lock-in | Hardware vendor | Cloud provider |

## Cost Analysis

### On-Premise Costs

**Hardware.** A single NVIDIA A100 GPU server costs $15,000-$30,000. A modest AI cluster (4-8 GPUs) costs $60,000-$240,000. Refresh cycle: 3-4 years as new GPU generations arrive.

**Facilities.** Power, cooling, rack space. GPU servers draw significant power (2-5 kW per server). Annual power and cooling costs can equal 20-30% of hardware cost.

**Staff.** Hardware management, networking, security, and maintenance require dedicated staff. One to two FTEs for a small AI cluster.

**Software.** Operating systems, container orchestration, monitoring tools, security tools. Some are free (open source), others require licenses.

### Cloud Costs

**GPU instances.** AWS p4d.24xlarge (8x A100): ~$32.77/hour on-demand, ~$19.66/hour with 1-year reserved. Monthly cost for one instance running continuously: ~$23,600 on-demand, ~$14,200 reserved.

**Managed services.** Bedrock, SageMaker, and other AI services charge per-use. Costs scale with usage, which can be advantageous for variable workloads.

**Storage and networking.** S3 storage is cheap ($0.023/GB/month). Data transfer out to the internet costs $0.09/GB. Cross-region transfer costs $0.02/GB.

### Break-Even Analysis

For a workload running 24/7 on 4 GPUs:
- Cloud (reserved): ~$57,000/year
- On-premise (amortized over 3 years): ~$40,000/year (hardware) + $15,000/year (power/cooling) + $50,000/year (0.5 FTE for operations) = ~$105,000/year

Cloud is cheaper until the GPU count and utilization justify dedicated operations staff. The break-even point is typically 8-16 continuously utilized GPUs with an existing operations team.

For variable workloads (training jobs that run for hours then stop), cloud is almost always cheaper because you pay only for usage.

## Capability Comparison

### Managed AI Services

Cloud platforms provide managed AI services not available on-premise:
- **Foundation model APIs** (Bedrock, Azure OpenAI) - access to Claude, GPT-4, Llama without hosting
- **Managed training** (SageMaker) - distributed training without cluster management
- **Auto-scaling inference** - model serving that scales automatically with demand
- **Data labeling** (Ground Truth) - managed labeling workflows

These services significantly accelerate AI development. On-premise teams must build equivalent capabilities from open-source tools, which requires substantial engineering investment.

### Hardware Flexibility

Cloud provides access to the latest GPU hardware (H100, future generations) without procurement delays. On-premise teams are locked to their purchased hardware for years. Given the rapid pace of GPU improvement, this flexibility is valuable.

### Data Processing

Cloud platforms offer scalable data processing (EMR, Glue, Athena) that complements AI workloads. On-premise teams must maintain their own Spark clusters, data warehouses, and processing infrastructure.

## Security and Compliance

**On-premise advantages:**
- Complete physical control of data
- No third-party access to infrastructure
- Simplifies compliance for data that cannot leave the premises
- Air-gapped environments for classified workloads

**Cloud advantages:**
- Cloud providers invest billions in security
- Compliance certifications (HIPAA, PCI, FedRAMP, SOC 2) are pre-built
- Encryption, IAM, and audit logging are native
- Security patches are applied by the provider

For most organizations, cloud security is stronger than on-premise security. The exceptions are classified government workloads, specific regulatory requirements mandating physical data control, and organizations with mature, well-resourced security teams.

## Hybrid Approach

Many organizations use a hybrid model:
- **Cloud for development and experimentation:** Data scientists use cloud notebooks and GPU instances for exploration. No upfront investment, instant access.
- **On-premise for production inference:** Models trained in the cloud are deployed on-premise for latency, data sovereignty, or cost reasons.
- **Cloud for burst capacity:** When large training jobs exceed on-premise capacity, burst to cloud GPU instances.

This approach balances cost, capability, and control.

## When to Choose On-Premise

- Strict data sovereignty requirements that cloud regions cannot satisfy
- Consistent, high GPU utilization (8+ GPUs running 24/7)
- Existing data center infrastructure and operations team
- Edge or latency requirements that cloud cannot meet
- Classified or air-gapped workloads

## When to Choose Cloud

- Variable or unpredictable GPU demand
- Need managed AI services (Bedrock, SageMaker)
- Rapid experimentation and prototyping
- No existing data center infrastructure
- Small to medium AI team without hardware operations expertise
- Need access to latest GPU hardware without procurement delays

For most organizations starting their AI journey, cloud is the right choice. It provides faster time to value, lower initial investment, and access to managed services that accelerate development. On-premise becomes attractive only at significant scale with predictable utilization.
