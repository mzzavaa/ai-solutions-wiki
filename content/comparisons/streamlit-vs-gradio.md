Streamlit and Gradio let Python developers build web interfaces for AI applications without writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Both are popular for AI demos, internal tools, and prototyping. They differ in focus: Gradio is optimized for ML model interfaces, while Streamlit is a more general-purpose data application framework.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Streamlit | Gradio |
|---|---|---|
| Primary focus | Data apps and dashboards | ML model interfaces |
| Language | Python only | Python only |
| Learning curve | Very low | Very low |
| Chat interface | st.chat_message, st.chat_input | gr.ChatInterface |
| File upload | st.file_uploader | gr.File, gr.Image, gr.Audio |
| Real-time streaming | Supported | Supported |
| Sharing | Streamlit Community Cloud | Hugging Face Spaces |
| API generation | No (app only) | Automatic API for every interface |
| Theming | Custom themes | Custom themes |
| State management | st.session_state | gr.State |
| Deployment | Docker, Streamlit Cloud | Docker, Hugging Face Spaces |

## ML-Specific Features

### Gradio Advantages

**Automatic API generation.** Every Gradio interface automatically creates an API endpoint. This means your demo interface doubles as an API that other applications can call programmatically. This is uniquely valuable for ML applications where others want to integrate with your model.

**Input/Output components.** Gradio has purpose-built components for ML inputs and outputs: Image, Audio, Video, 3D Model, Dataframe, Label, HighlightedText. These components handle file format conversion, preprocessing, and display automatically.

**Hugging Face integration.** Gradio is maintained by Hugging Face and integrates natively with the Hugging Face ecosystem. Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces is one click. Loading models from the Hub is built in.

**Flagging.** Users can flag problematic model outputs for review. This built-in feedback mechanism is useful for collecting training data and identifying model failures.

### Streamlit Advantages

**General-purpose data apps.** Streamlit supports complex layouts, multiple pages, data visualization (charts, maps, tables), and interactive widgets. It is better for building data dashboards and tools that go beyond model input/output.

**Layout control.** Columns, sidebars, tabs, expanders, and containers provide flexible layout options. Gradio has layout components too, but Streamlit's are more mature.

**Richer widget set.** Sliders, date inputs, multiselects, color pickers, and other interactive widgets for parameter exploration.

**Caching.** st.cache_data and st.cache_resource efficiently cache expensive computations and loaded models. Reduces redundant computation and model loading.

## Chat Interfaces

Both support chat interfaces, which is the primary UI pattern for LLM applications:

**Streamlit** provides st.chat_message and st.chat_input for building chat UIs. You manage the conversation state manually using st.session_state. Streaming is supported by writing to st.chat_message incrementally.

**Gradio** provides gr.ChatInterface, a high-level component that handles conversation state, message display, and streaming automatically. Less customizable but faster to implement.

For a standard chatbot interface, Gradio gets you there faster. For a customized chat experience (custom layouts, side panels, tool outputs), Streamlit provides more flexibility.

## Performance and Scaling

Both are designed for demos and internal tools, not high-traffic production applications:

**Streamlit** reruns the entire script on every interaction. This execution model is simple but can be slow for complex applications. Caching mitigates this but adds complexity.

**Gradio** uses a more traditional event-driven model. Only the relevant function runs on interaction. This is more efficient for complex interfaces.

Neither is designed for hundreds of concurrent users. For production-grade AI applications, use a proper web framework (FastAPI + React/Next.js) instead.

## Deployment

**Streamlit Community Cloud** provides free hosting for public Streamlit apps. Private apps require a paid plan. Custom deployment via Docker is straightforward.

**Hugging Face Spaces** provides free hosting for Gradio apps with GPU access available (paid). The integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem makes it the natural home for ML demos.

Both deploy easily in Docker containers to any cloud platform (ECS, Cloud Run, App Service).

## When to Choose Streamlit

- Building a data dashboard or analytics tool with AI features
- Need complex layouts (sidebars, multiple pages, tabs)
- Building internal tools that combine data visualization with AI
- Need rich interactive widgets beyond model input/output
- Prefer the Streamlit Community Cloud for deployment

## When to Choose Gradio

- Building a demo interface for an ML model
- Want an automatic API alongside the UI
- Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces
- Working with multi-modal inputs (images, audio, video)
- Want the fastest path from model to shareable demo
- Need flagging for collecting user feedback on model outputs

## Beyond Prototyping

Both Streamlit and Gradio are excellent for prototyping and internal tools. For customer-facing production applications, they have limitations: limited customization, scalability constraints, and professional design limitations. Plan to migrate to a production web framework (Next.js, React + FastAPI) when the application moves from internal tool to customer product. The prototype's value is in validating the AI functionality, not in the UI framework.
