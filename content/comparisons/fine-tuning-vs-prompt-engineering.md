When an LLM does not produce the output you need, you have two primary levers: change what you send to the model (prompt engineering) or change the model itself (fine-tuning). Both approaches customize LLM behavior, but they differ in cost, effort, maintainability, and the types of improvements they enable.

## Overview

| Aspect | Prompt Engineering | Fine-Tuning |
|---|---|---|
| Setup Cost | Near zero | Dataset creation + training |
| Iteration Speed | Minutes | Hours to days |
| Token Cost | Higher (longer prompts) | Lower (shorter prompts) |
| Training Data | Few-shot examples in prompt | Hundreds to thousands of examples |
| Model Updates | Adapt prompt to new model | Retrain for each base model |
| Knowledge Addition | Effective for format/style | Effective for specialized knowledge |
| Maintenance | Prompt versioning | Dataset + model versioning |

## What Prompt Engineering Can Do

Prompt engineering shapes model behavior through instructions, examples, and context provided at inference time. System prompts define the role and constraints. Few-shot examples demonstrate the desired output format. Chain-of-thought instructions improve reasoning. Retrieved context (RAG) provides relevant knowledge.

Prompt engineering is effective for output formatting, tone adjustment, task framing, role-playing, and providing specific context. A well-engineered prompt can dramatically change model behavior without any model modification.

## What Fine-Tuning Can Do

Fine-tuning updates model weights on your training data, permanently encoding patterns into the model. This is effective for teaching the model new skills, domain-specific knowledge, consistent output formats that prompting struggles to maintain, and behavioral patterns that are difficult to describe in instructions.

Fine-tuning also reduces inference costs. A fine-tuned model can produce the desired output with shorter prompts, eliminating the need for lengthy system prompts and many few-shot examples. For high-volume inference, this token savings is significant.

## Quality Comparison

For most tasks, a well-engineered prompt with a strong base model produces better results than a fine-tuned weaker model. The quality hierarchy is typically: strong model + good prompt > fine-tuned weak model > weak model + good prompt.

Fine-tuning wins when the task requires consistent adherence to specific formats, domain-specific patterns that are hard to describe in prompts, or behaviors that few-shot examples cannot reliably induce. Classification tasks, structured extraction, and domain-specific language generation often benefit from fine-tuning.

## Cost Analysis

Prompt engineering has no upfront cost but higher per-inference cost due to longer prompts. Fine-tuning has significant upfront cost (dataset creation, training compute, evaluation) but lower per-inference cost. The break-even point depends on inference volume. For low-volume use cases, prompt engineering is always cheaper. For high-volume production use, fine-tuning often pays for itself through reduced prompt tokens.

## Maintenance

Prompt engineering requires maintaining prompt templates and updating them when model versions change. Different models may need different prompts for the same task. Version control and testing infrastructure for prompts are maturing but still less established than traditional software practices.

Fine-tuning requires maintaining training datasets, retraining when base models update, evaluating fine-tuned models against benchmarks, and managing model artifacts. The operational burden is significantly higher than prompt engineering.

## When to Choose Prompt Engineering

Start with prompt engineering. It is the right approach when you are iterating on requirements, when your use case works well with few-shot examples, when you need to switch between models easily, when inference volume is low to moderate, or when you do not have a curated training dataset.

## When to Choose Fine-Tuning

Choose fine-tuning when prompt engineering has been optimized and still falls short, when you have a well-curated training dataset of hundreds or more examples, when inference volume is high enough to justify the upfront investment, when you need to reduce prompt length for latency or cost reasons, or when the desired behavior is difficult to describe in instructions but easy to demonstrate in examples.

## Practical Recommendation

Always exhaust prompt engineering before fine-tuning. The majority of LLM applications in production use prompt engineering alone. Fine-tuning is a specialized tool for specific situations - not a default approach. When you do fine-tune, maintain a strong prompt engineering baseline to measure fine-tuning's incremental value.
