Time-series data - metrics, IoT readings, log events, financial ticks - requires storage optimized for temporal queries. Amazon Timestream is purpose-built for time-series. DynamoDB is a general-purpose NoSQL database that can handle time-series workloads with the right schema design. The choice depends on query patterns, scale, and how much time-series optimization you need.

## Overview

| Aspect | Amazon Timestream | DynamoDB |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Time-series database | General-purpose NoSQL |
| Query Language | SQL-like with time functions | PartiQL or API-based |
| Data Lifecycle | Automatic tiered storage | TTL-based expiration |
| Aggregations | Built-in temporal aggregations | Requires application logic |
| Interpolation | Built-in gap filling | Not supported |
| Scaling | Serverless auto-scaling | Provisioned or on-demand |
| Max Item Size | 2 KB per row | 400 KB per item |

## Time-Series Query Capabilities

Timestream provides SQL with built-in time-series functions: `bin()` for time bucketing, `interpolate_*` for gap filling, `ago()` for relative time ranges, and time-series-specific aggregations. You can write queries like "average CPU utilization in 5-minute bins over the last 24 hours" in a single SQL statement.

DynamoDB does not have built-in time-series functions. You query by partition key and sort key (typically a timestamp), then perform aggregations in application code. This works for simple lookups (last N readings from sensor X) but becomes complex for cross-dimensional aggregations and time-windowed analytics.

## Data Lifecycle Management

Timestream automatically manages data tiering. Recent data stays in a memory store for fast access. Older data moves to a magnetic store for cost-effective long-term retention. You configure retention policies per table, and Timestream handles the migration transparently. Queries span both tiers seamlessly.

DynamoDB offers TTL (time-to-live) for automatic item deletion, but has no built-in tiered storage. For long-term retention at lower cost, you must implement a pipeline to archive old items to S3. This is additional engineering work but gives you more control over the archival format.

## Scale and Performance

Timestream scales automatically with no capacity planning. Write throughput and query concurrency adjust to workload. However, Timestream has row size limits (2 KB) and ingestion rate limits that can be constraining for very high-volume workloads.

DynamoDB handles massive scale with provisioned or on-demand capacity. Single-digit millisecond reads and writes are consistent. For time-series patterns, DynamoDB requires careful partition key design to avoid hot partitions (e.g., using composite keys with device ID + time shard).

## AI/ML Integration

For ML workloads, both services feed data into training pipelines differently. Timestream data can be queried via SQL and exported for training, or queried directly from SageMaker notebooks. Its temporal aggregation functions simplify feature engineering for time-series models.

DynamoDB data flows to ML pipelines through DynamoDB Streams (for real-time) or S3 exports (for batch). DynamoDB's flexibility in item structure can be advantageous when time-series records have varying schemas across different source types.

## When to Choose Timestream

Choose Timestream when your primary access pattern is temporal analytics - dashboards, monitoring, trend analysis, and anomaly detection across time. IoT telemetry, application metrics, and DevOps monitoring are natural fits. Timestream's built-in functions eliminate the need to implement temporal logic in application code.

## When to Choose DynamoDB

Choose DynamoDB when time-series is one of several access patterns for your data, when you need sub-millisecond latency for individual lookups, when your items exceed 2 KB, or when you need the flexibility of a general-purpose database. DynamoDB is also the better choice when your application already uses DynamoDB for other data and adding a separate time-series database is not justified.

## Practical Recommendation

For dedicated time-series workloads with analytical query patterns, Timestream reduces development time significantly. For mixed workloads where time-series is one access pattern among many, DynamoDB's flexibility avoids managing an additional database service. If you just need to store and retrieve recent readings with simple lookups, DynamoDB is simpler. If you need temporal aggregations, trend analysis, or anomaly detection queries, Timestream pays for itself in reduced application complexity.
