ML pipelines need orchestration: run data ingestion, then preprocessing, then training, then evaluation, then conditionally deploy. Apache Airflow and AWS Step Functions are the two most common orchestrators for these workflows on AWS.

## Platform Overview

**Apache Airflow** is an open-source workflow orchestration platform. Workflows (DAGs) are defined in Python. Amazon MWAA (Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow) provides managed Airflow on AWS. Airflow has a rich ecosystem of operators for integrating with external services.

**AWS Step Functions** is a serverless workflow orchestration service. Workflows are defined in Amazon States Language (JSON) or using the AWS SDK's workflow builder. Step Functions integrates natively with 200+ AWS services.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Airflow (MWAA) | Step Functions |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow definition | Python (DAGs) | JSON/YAML (ASL) or SDK |
| Scheduling | Built-in scheduler (cron, intervals) | EventBridge rules (separate) |
| Visual designer | Airflow UI (DAG visualization) | Workflow Studio (visual builder) |
| AWS integrations | Via operators (150+ providers) | Native (200+ services) |
| Error handling | Retry, on_failure callbacks | Retry, Catch, fallback states |
| Parallel execution | Yes (parallel tasks) | Yes (Parallel, Map states) |
| Human approval | Custom operator (e.g., Slack) | Manual approval via callback |
| Cost | MWAA environment ($0.49/hour minimum) | Per state transition ($0.025/1000) |
| Max execution time | Unlimited | 1 year (Express: 5 minutes) |
| State management | XCom (limited), external storage | Built-in state passing |

## ML Pipeline Fit

### Data Processing Pipelines

**Airflow** excels at scheduled data pipelines. Define a DAG that runs daily: pull data from sources, validate, transform, load into the feature store. Airflow's scheduler handles the cadence, retries, and backfills. The Python-native DAG definition makes complex branching logic natural.

**Step Functions** handles data pipelines through integration with Glue, Lambda, and ECS. The visual workflow builder makes simple pipelines easy to create. Complex branching logic is more verbose in ASL than in Python.

**Advantage:** Airflow for complex, scheduled data pipelines

### Model Training Pipelines

**Airflow** can trigger SageMaker training jobs via the SageMaker operator, wait for completion, and proceed to evaluation. The SageMaker operator is mature and well-documented.

**Step Functions** has native SageMaker integration: CreateTrainingJob, CreateTransformJob, CreateEndpoint. No custom code needed. The integration is direct and handles polling and error cases automatically.

**Advantage:** Step Functions for simple SageMaker pipelines; Airflow for complex pipelines with many custom steps

### Deployment Pipelines

**Airflow** can orchestrate multi-stage deployments but is not primarily a deployment tool. Using Airflow for blue-green or canary deployments requires custom operators.

**Step Functions** integrates with CodeDeploy, ECS, and Lambda for deployment. Parallel deployment to multiple environments and wait-for-approval states are built in.

**Advantage:** Step Functions for deployment orchestration

## Operational Considerations

**MWAA** runs a persistent Airflow environment (scheduler, web server, workers). Minimum cost: ~$360/month for the smallest environment. The environment runs continuously, regardless of pipeline activity. Scaling workers for burst workloads requires configuration.

**Step Functions** is truly serverless. No infrastructure to manage. You pay only when workflows execute. Idle cost: zero. Scales automatically to any workload.

For teams running pipelines frequently (daily or more), MWAA's fixed cost is amortized. For teams running pipelines weekly or monthly, Step Functions' pay-per-execution model is more cost-effective.

## Developer Experience

**Airflow** DAGs are Python code. ML engineers and data scientists are comfortable writing Python. The DAG defines the workflow clearly, and custom logic is just Python functions. Testing DAGs locally is straightforward. The Airflow community provides operators for almost every service.

**Step Functions** workflows are defined in JSON (ASL) or using the SDK. ASL is verbose for complex logic. The Workflow Studio visual builder helps for simple workflows but becomes unwieldy for complex ones. Custom logic requires Lambda functions, adding a layer of indirection.

For ML teams that think in Python, Airflow is more natural. For platform teams building reusable workflow patterns, Step Functions' declarative approach is cleaner.

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Airflow for Everything

Use MWAA to orchestrate all ML pipelines: data ingestion, training, evaluation, deployment. Works well for teams with Airflow expertise and complex, frequently-running pipelines.

### Pattern 2: Step Functions for Everything

Use Step Functions for all workflow orchestration. Works well for AWS-native teams with simpler pipeline logic and variable execution frequency.

### Pattern 3: Airflow + Step Functions

Airflow handles complex, scheduled data pipelines (daily data processing, feature engineering). Step Functions handles event-driven workflows (model deployment triggered by model registry update, inference pipeline triggered by API call).

## Recommendation

**Choose Airflow (MWAA)** when you have complex ML pipelines with many steps, need Python-native workflow definition, run pipelines frequently (daily or more), or the team already knows Airflow.

**Choose Step Functions** when you want serverless operation with zero idle cost, need tight AWS service integration, run pipelines infrequently, or prefer visual workflow design for simple pipelines.
