The microservices vs monolith debate is well-established in software engineering. AI applications add new dimensions: model serving has different scaling requirements than business logic, data pipelines have different deployment cycles than APIs, and ML experiments benefit from rapid iteration that monoliths enable. This comparison addresses AI-specific architectural considerations.

## Architecture Patterns

### Monolithic AI Application

All components in a single deployable unit: API layer, business logic, model inference, data processing, and sometimes even the model training pipeline.

**Example:** A FastAPI application that loads a model at startup, processes requests through business logic, runs inference, and returns results. All code is in one repository, deployed as one container.

### Microservice AI Application

Components separated into independently deployable services: model serving service, API gateway, data processing service, feature service, and business logic service.

**Example:** An API gateway routes requests to a business logic service, which calls a model serving service (TGI, vLLM, or SageMaker endpoint) for inference and a feature service for real-time features.

## Comparison

| Aspect | Monolith | Microservices |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment complexity | Low (one artifact) | High (multiple services) |
| Development speed (small team) | Fast | Slower (service coordination) |
| Development speed (large team) | Slow (merge conflicts, coordination) | Fast (independent teams) |
| Scaling flexibility | Entire application scales together | Individual services scale independently |
| Model update independence | Redeploy everything for model change | Update model service only |
| Latency | Low (in-process calls) | Higher (network calls between services) |
| Debugging | Easier (single process) | Harder (distributed tracing needed) |
| Technology flexibility | One technology stack | Each service can use optimal stack |
| Operational overhead | Low | High (monitoring, networking, discovery) |

## AI-Specific Considerations

### Model Scaling

AI models often have different scaling characteristics than business logic:
- Models may need GPU instances while business logic needs only CPU
- Model inference latency varies with input size; business logic is typically consistent
- Model memory requirements can be large (GB) while business logic is lightweight

**Microservices advantage:** Model serving scales independently on GPU instances. Business logic scales independently on cheaper CPU instances. You pay for GPU only where needed.

**Monolith limitation:** The entire application must run on GPU instances even though only the model inference needs GPU. This wastes expensive GPU resources on business logic that would run fine on CPU.

### Experimentation Velocity

During model development, the team iterates rapidly on model changes:

**Monolith advantage:** Changing the model is changing one codebase. No API contracts between services to update. The data scientist can modify the model and the preprocessing in one change. Faster iteration during development.

**Microservices overhead:** Changing the model might require updating the model service, the feature service, and the API contract between them. Three deployments instead of one. Slower iteration.

### Multi-Model Applications

Applications using multiple models (classification + entity extraction + summarization):

**Monolith approach:** All models loaded in one process. Models share memory, which can be efficient. But one model's memory leak or crash affects everything.

**Microservices approach:** Each model in its own service. Models scale independently. A crash in the summarization service does not affect classification. Different models can use different hardware.

### Data Pipeline Independence

Data pipelines for training and inference often have different deployment cycles:

**Monolith:** Pipeline changes require redeploying the entire application, even if only the data processing logic changed.

**Microservices:** Data pipeline runs as a separate service with its own deployment cycle. Updates to data processing do not affect model serving.

## The Practical Middle Ground: Modular Monolith

For most AI applications, especially early-stage ones, the modular monolith provides the best balance:

**Structure:** Single deployable unit, but internally organized into clear modules with defined interfaces (model module, data module, API module, business logic module).

**Benefits:**
- Simple deployment and operations
- Fast development iteration
- Clear boundaries between components
- Easy to extract modules into services later if needed

**When to extract to microservices:** Extract a module into a service when it needs independent scaling (model serving needs GPUs), independent deployment (model updates should not require full redeployment), or team independence (model team and API team want separate deployment cycles).

## Team Size Guidance

**1-3 engineers:** Monolith. The operational overhead of microservices is not justified. A small team cannot effectively manage multiple services.

**4-8 engineers:** Modular monolith or 2-3 services. Extract the model serving service if GPU scaling is needed. Keep everything else together.

**8+ engineers:** Consider microservices based on team structure. Each team owns a service. Shared services (model serving, feature store) are maintained by platform teams.

## Migration Path

Start monolithic, extract to microservices based on observed needs:

1. **Build monolith.** Get the AI application working end-to-end.
2. **Identify scaling pain points.** Is model serving the bottleneck? Is the data pipeline blocking API changes?
3. **Extract the highest-value service first.** Usually the model serving component (different scaling, different hardware).
4. **Stabilize.** Let the team adapt to operating two services before extracting more.
5. **Continue extracting based on need,** not based on architectural aspiration.

## Recommendation

**Start with a monolith** for new AI applications. The speed of development and simplicity of operations outweigh the scaling limitations for the first 6-12 months. Extract to microservices when you have concrete evidence (not theoretical concerns) that the monolith is limiting your ability to scale, deploy, or organize teams effectively.

The worst outcome is a distributed monolith: microservices that are tightly coupled, deployed together, and have all the complexity of microservices with none of the benefits. This happens when teams extract services prematurely before understanding the boundaries.
