Data quality validation prevents bad data from producing bad models. Great Expectations and Deequ are the two most widely used open-source data quality tools for ML pipelines. They take different approaches: Great Expectations is a Python-native framework for defining and running data expectations; Deequ is a Scala/Spark library for data quality profiling and constraint verification. This comparison covers the differences that matter for ML data pipeline teams.

## Tool Overview

**Great Expectations** (GX, 2018) is a Python framework that lets you define "expectations" about your data: expected column types, value ranges, uniqueness, null rates, distribution properties, and custom validations. Expectations are organized into suites and validated against data batches. GX generates data documentation ("Data Docs") automatically.

**AWS Deequ** (2018, Amazon) is a Scala library built on Apache Spark. It provides data profiling (automatic statistics computation), constraint suggestion (proposes constraints based on data), constraint verification (validates data against defined constraints), and anomaly detection (identifies data drift over time).

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Great Expectations | Deequ |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python | Scala (Spark) |
| Data backends | Pandas, Spark, SQL (many databases) | Spark only |
| Expectation definition | Python API, JSON config | Scala DSL |
| Built-in expectations | 300+ | ~30 constraint types |
| Custom expectations | Python classes | Scala functions |
| Data profiling | Basic (via profiler) | Advanced (column statistics, histograms) |
| Constraint suggestion | Yes (rule-based) | Yes (profiling-based) |
| Anomaly detection | Limited | Built-in (time-series aware) |
| Data documentation | Data Docs (HTML reports) | JSON metrics output |
| Checkpoint automation | Yes (checkpoint API) | Manual (integrate into Spark jobs) |
| Orchestrator integration | Airflow, Dagster, Prefect | Airflow (via Spark operators) |
| Cloud integration | GX Cloud (managed) | AWS Glue native integration |
| Community | Large Python data community | Spark/AWS community |

## Data Quality for ML Pipelines

### Validating Training Data

Before training a model, validate the training dataset:

**Great Expectations** defines an expectation suite for the training data. Example expectations: `expect_column_values_to_not_be_null("target")`, `expect_column_values_to_be_between("age", 0, 150)`, `expect_column_distinct_values_to_be_in_set("category", ["A", "B", "C"])`. Run the suite as a step in the training pipeline. If expectations fail, the pipeline stops before training begins.

**Deequ** defines constraints similarly: `isComplete("target")`, `isContainedIn("category", Array("A", "B", "C"))`, `hasMin("age", _ >= 0)`. Deequ runs these checks as a Spark job, producing a constraint verification report. Failed constraints halt the pipeline.

Both tools prevent the scenario of training a model on corrupt data and only discovering the problem when model performance degrades.

### Detecting Data Drift

**Deequ's advantage:** Built-in anomaly detection tracks metrics over time and alerts when metrics deviate from historical baselines. For example, if the mean of a feature shifts by more than two standard deviations from its historical average, Deequ flags it. This is implemented as a Spark job that compares current metrics against a stored metric repository.

**Great Expectations' approach:** GX does not have built-in time-series anomaly detection but supports distribution expectations (`expect_column_kl_divergence_to_be_less_than`) that compare current data distributions against a reference distribution. Teams typically implement drift detection by comparing expectations results across batches.

### Validating Feature Engineering Output

After feature engineering, validate that the output features match the expected schema and distributions. Both tools support this, but GX's broader backend support (Pandas, SQL, Spark) makes it easier to validate features regardless of where they are stored. Deequ requires the features to be in a Spark DataFrame.

## Developer Experience

**Great Expectations** has a richer developer experience for Python teams. The expectation library is extensive, the Data Docs feature generates browsable HTML documentation, and the checkpoint API integrates cleanly with pipeline orchestrators. The learning curve is moderate: defining expectations is straightforward, but configuring data sources and stores requires reading the documentation carefully.

**Deequ** is more concise but requires Scala/Spark expertise. The constraint suggestion feature is particularly useful for onboarding: point Deequ at a dataset and it proposes constraints based on the data's actual properties. This bootstraps the quality validation process faster than writing expectations from scratch.

## Integration Patterns

**Airflow + Great Expectations:** Use the GX Airflow operator to run checkpoint validations as DAG tasks. If validation fails, the downstream tasks (training, feature materialization) do not execute.

**Airflow + Deequ:** Run Deequ as part of a Spark job triggered by an Airflow SparkSubmitOperator or EMR operator. Parse the Deequ output to determine pass/fail and branch the DAG accordingly.

**Dagster + Great Expectations:** GX integrates as a Dagster resource. Asset checks use GX expectations, and failed checks prevent downstream asset materialization.

## When to Choose Great Expectations

- Python-based data pipelines (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- Need for extensive built-in expectations (300+)
- Multi-backend environment (validate data in databases, files, and Spark)
- Team wants automated data documentation (Data Docs)
- Non-Spark environments or small-to-medium data volumes

## When to Choose Deequ

- Spark-based data pipelines (AWS EMR, Glue, Databricks)
- Need for built-in data profiling and constraint suggestion
- Time-series anomaly detection for data drift monitoring
- AWS-native environment with Glue integration
- Large-scale data (terabytes) that requires Spark's distributed processing

## Using Both

Some teams use both: Deequ for large-scale Spark-based validation and profiling on data lake tables, and Great Expectations for validating smaller datasets in Python-based feature engineering and serving pipelines. The tools are complementary rather than mutually exclusive.
