Experiment tracking is the foundation of reproducible machine learning. MLflow and Weights & Biases (W&B) are the two dominant tools in this space, but they serve different audiences and philosophies. MLflow is open-source infrastructure you host yourself. W&B is a managed platform with a polished UI and collaboration features.

## Overview

| Aspect | MLflow | Weights & Biases |
|---|---|---|
| Licensing | Open source (Apache 2.0) | Proprietary SaaS (free tier available) |
| Hosting | Self-hosted or Databricks managed | W&B managed cloud or self-hosted |
| Core Strength | Broad MLOps lifecycle | Experiment tracking and visualization |
| Model Registry | Built-in | Built-in (W&B Registry) |
| UI Quality | Functional | Highly polished |
| Framework Support | Framework-agnostic | Deep integrations with PyTorch, HuggingFace, etc. |
| Pricing | Free (infrastructure costs) | Free for individuals, paid for teams |

## Experiment Tracking

Both tools log parameters, metrics, and artifacts. The differences are in ergonomics.

MLflow's tracking API is straightforward: `mlflow.log_param()`, `mlflow.log_metric()`, `mlflow.log_artifact()`. Auto-logging for major frameworks (scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow) reduces boilerplate. The tracking UI shows runs in a table with sortable columns and basic charts.

W&B provides richer visualization out of the box. Real-time training dashboards update as models train. Custom panels let you build complex visualizations without code. The comparison view for multiple runs is significantly more powerful than MLflow's default UI, with parallel coordinates plots, scatter plots, and correlation analysis.

## Model Registry

MLflow's model registry is mature and widely adopted. Models progress through stages (None, Staging, Production, Archived), and the registry integrates with MLflow's deployment tools. Databricks enhances this with Unity Catalog integration.

W&B Registry provides model versioning and lineage tracking with links back to the training runs that produced each model. It integrates with W&B Launch for deployment workflows. The registry is newer than MLflow's but is catching up in functionality.

## Collaboration

W&B was designed for team collaboration from day one. Reports let you create shareable documents that embed live charts and run comparisons. Team dashboards aggregate experiments across projects. Comments and annotations on specific runs support asynchronous review.

MLflow's collaboration story depends on your deployment. The open-source server has no user management. Databricks-managed MLflow adds access controls, comments, and sharing. Self-hosted MLflow requires you to build these features yourself or use a managed offering.

## Data and Artifact Management

W&B Artifacts provide dataset versioning, lineage tracking, and deduplication. You can track which datasets produced which models and trace lineage end to end.

MLflow artifacts are simpler - files stored alongside runs. MLflow does not provide built-in dataset versioning, though you can log dataset metadata. For full data versioning, MLflow users typically add DVC or Delta Lake.

## When to Choose MLflow

Choose MLflow when you need open-source flexibility and want to avoid vendor lock-in. If you are already on Databricks, MLflow is deeply integrated and the obvious choice. MLflow also works well when experiment tracking is just one component of a broader MLOps platform you are assembling from open-source parts.

## When to Choose W&B

Choose W&B when experiment visualization and team collaboration are priorities. Research teams that need to compare hundreds of runs across hyperparameter sweeps benefit from W&B's superior visualization. Teams that want a managed service with minimal infrastructure overhead also favor W&B. The free tier is generous enough for small teams and individual researchers.

## Practical Recommendation

For production ML platforms at scale, MLflow's open-source model and broad ecosystem integration make it the safer long-term choice. For research teams and rapid experimentation, W&B's visualization and collaboration features justify the SaaS dependency. Some teams use both - W&B for experiment tracking during development, MLflow for the model registry and production deployment pipeline.
