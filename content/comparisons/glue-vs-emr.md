AWS Glue and Amazon EMR both run Apache Spark workloads, but they target different operational models. Glue is serverless ETL. EMR is managed cluster infrastructure. For AI/ML data pipelines, the choice affects cost, control, and operational complexity.

## Overview

| Aspect | AWS Glue | Amazon EMR |
|---|---|---|
| Operational Model | Serverless | Managed clusters (or serverless) |
| Primary Use | ETL and data integration | General-purpose big data processing |
| Spark Support | PySpark, Spark SQL | Full Spark ecosystem |
| Other Engines | None | Hive, Presto, Flink, HBase, etc. |
| Cluster Management | None (serverless) | You manage (or EMR Serverless) |
| Data Catalog | Built-in Glue Data Catalog | Uses Glue Data Catalog |
| Job Authoring | Visual + code | Code (notebooks, scripts) |
| Pricing | Per-DPU-hour | Per-instance-hour |

## Architecture

Glue abstracts away cluster management entirely. You define jobs (visual or code), specify the number of DPUs (data processing units), and Glue handles provisioning, scaling, and teardown. Glue jobs run on a managed Spark environment with automatic retries and job bookmarking for incremental processing.

EMR gives you full cluster control. You choose instance types, cluster size, applications to install, and configuration parameters. EMR on EC2 provides maximum control. EMR on EKS runs Spark on your Kubernetes clusters. EMR Serverless provides a serverless option that competes more directly with Glue.

## Data Cataloging

Glue Data Catalog is a shared metadata repository that both services use. Glue crawlers automatically discover schema and create catalog tables. EMR jobs read and write through the same catalog. This shared catalog means you can use Glue for data discovery and cataloging while running heavy processing on EMR.

## Feature Engineering for ML

For ML feature engineering, both services run Spark-based transformations. Glue is simpler for scheduled ETL jobs that prepare training data - daily feature aggregations, data cleaning, and dataset generation. The visual editor lets analysts build transformations without writing code.

EMR is better for complex feature engineering that needs custom libraries, GPU instances for deep learning preprocessing, or multiple processing engines. EMR notebooks provide an interactive environment for exploratory feature development before productionizing in pipelines.

## Cost Comparison

Glue charges per DPU-hour with a minimum of 1 DPU and a 1-minute minimum billing increment. For short, scheduled ETL jobs, Glue is cost-effective because you pay only for processing time.

EMR charges per instance-hour with per-second billing. For long-running clusters or large-scale processing, EMR can be significantly cheaper, especially with Reserved Instances or Spot Instances. EMR Serverless offers consumption-based pricing similar to Glue.

For bursty, scheduled workloads, Glue wins on cost. For sustained, large-scale processing, EMR with Spot Instances is typically 3-5x cheaper than Glue.

## When to Choose Glue

Choose Glue for scheduled ETL jobs, data catalog management, and simple-to-moderate Spark transformations. Glue excels when you want zero infrastructure management, when your jobs run on a schedule (hourly, daily), and when the visual editor helps non-engineers contribute to data pipelines. Glue is the default choice for data preparation steps in ML pipelines on AWS.

## When to Choose EMR

Choose EMR when you need full control over the processing environment, when you run multiple engines beyond Spark, when GPU instances are required, or when cost optimization through Spot Instances is important at scale. EMR is also the better choice for interactive data exploration and when your processing jobs run continuously rather than on a schedule.

## Practical Recommendation

For ML data pipelines, start with Glue for data preparation and feature engineering jobs. Move to EMR when jobs become too large for Glue's cost model, when you need GPU processing, or when you need engines beyond Spark. Many production architectures use both: Glue for cataloging and light ETL, EMR for heavy processing and interactive development.
