GDPR and the EU AI Act are complementary regulations, not alternatives. Organizations deploying AI systems that process personal data must comply with both simultaneously. Understanding where they overlap and diverge is essential for building compliant AI systems.

## Scope

**GDPR** applies to any processing of personal data of EU residents, regardless of whether AI is involved. It covers all organizations worldwide that process EU personal data. **EU AI Act** applies to AI systems placed on the EU market or whose output is used in the EU, regardless of whether personal data is involved. An AI system that processes only non-personal data (industrial equipment monitoring, for example) falls under the EU AI Act but not GDPR. An AI system processing personal data falls under both.

## Risk Approach

**GDPR** does not classify processing activities into risk tiers. Instead, it applies baseline requirements to all processing and adds specific obligations (like DPIAs) for high-risk processing. **EU AI Act** explicitly classifies AI systems into four risk categories: unacceptable (banned), high-risk (extensive requirements), limited risk (transparency obligations), and minimal risk (voluntary codes of conduct). This risk-based classification determines which obligations apply.

## Key Overlapping Requirements

**Transparency** - GDPR requires informing data subjects about automated decision-making and providing meaningful information about the logic involved. The EU AI Act requires disclosing AI interaction, marking AI-generated content, and providing detailed instructions for use of high-risk systems. Both push toward explainable AI, but from different angles. **Risk assessment** - GDPR requires DPIAs for high-risk processing. The EU AI Act requires risk management systems for high-risk AI. These are different assessments with different scopes, but they can be coordinated. **Human oversight** - GDPR Article 22 requires the option of human intervention in automated decisions. The EU AI Act requires human oversight measures for high-risk AI systems. **Documentation** - Both require documentation, but with different focuses: GDPR on data processing records, EU AI Act on technical system documentation.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | GDPR | EU AI Act |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Focus | Personal data protection | AI system safety and rights |
| Applies to | Personal data processing | AI systems on EU market |
| Key roles | Controller, Processor | Provider, Deployer, Importer |
| Enforcement | National DPAs | National AI authorities + market surveillance |
| Max fine | 4% global turnover or 20M EUR | 7% global turnover or 35M EUR |
| Conformity | Not applicable | Required for high-risk AI |

## Compliance Strategy

Organizations should not treat GDPR and EU AI Act compliance as separate workstreams. Many controls serve both: data governance supports both GDPR's data quality principle and the EU AI Act's training data requirements. Explainability mechanisms satisfy both GDPR's right to explanation and the EU AI Act's transparency obligations. Risk assessments can be coordinated, with the DPIA addressing data protection risks and the AI Act risk management system addressing broader safety and rights risks.

Build a unified compliance framework that maps each control to the specific articles of each regulation it satisfies. This avoids duplication of effort and ensures that no requirement falls through the cracks between teams.
