Playwright and Cypress are the two leading E2E testing frameworks. For AI-powered web applications, the choice matters more than for typical web apps because AI UIs have specific requirements: streaming response rendering, long async operations, network interception for mocking AI APIs, and handling non-deterministic content. This comparison evaluates both frameworks against these AI-specific needs.

## Architecture

**Playwright** operates outside the browser, controlling it via the Chrome DevTools Protocol (or equivalent for Firefox/WebKit). This out-of-process architecture means Playwright can control multiple browser contexts, handle multiple tabs, and intercept network traffic at the protocol level.

**Cypress** runs inside the browser alongside the application. This in-browser architecture gives Cypress direct access to the application's DOM and JavaScript context, enabling features like automatic waiting and time travel debugging. However, it limits Cypress to a single browser tab and introduces constraints around cross-origin requests.

**Winner for AI apps: Playwright.** The out-of-process architecture provides more flexibility for complex AI testing scenarios.

## Network Interception

AI applications need to mock LLM API responses for deterministic testing. Both frameworks support network interception but differ in capability.

**Playwright** intercepts requests at the protocol level. You can modify, delay, or replace any request, including WebSocket connections and Server-Sent Events (SSE). This is critical for mocking streaming AI responses.

```python
# Playwright: mock a streaming SSE response
page.route("**/api/chat", lambda route: route.fulfill(
    status=200,
    content_type="text/event-stream",
    body="data: {\"token\": \"Hello\"}\n\ndata: {\"token\": \" world\"}\n\ndata: [DONE]\n\n"
))
```

**Cypress** uses `cy.intercept()` which works well for standard HTTP requests but has limited support for SSE and WebSocket mocking. Streaming responses require workarounds.

```javascript
// Cypress: basic request interception
cy.intercept("POST", "/api/chat", { body: { response: "Hello world" } });
```

**Winner for AI apps: Playwright.** Superior SSE and streaming support is essential for testing modern AI chat interfaces.

## Handling Async Operations

AI operations are slow. Model inference takes 1-30 seconds. Document processing may take minutes.

**Playwright** uses explicit async/await patterns. You control exactly what you wait for and for how long. This is verbose but precise.

```python
page.locator(".streaming-indicator").wait_for(state="hidden", timeout=60000)
```

**Cypress** automatically retries assertions until they pass or timeout. This implicit waiting is convenient for fast operations but can obscure timing issues with slow AI operations. When an AI response takes 20 seconds, Cypress's default 4-second timeout fails silently, requiring explicit timeout overrides.

```javascript
cy.get(".response", { timeout: 60000 }).should("be.visible");
```

**Winner: Tie.** Playwright offers more control; Cypress offers more convenience. Both can handle long waits with proper configuration.

## Browser Support

**Playwright** supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit (Safari's engine) on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Cypress** supports Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Electron) and Firefox. No WebKit/Safari support.

**Winner: Playwright.** WebKit support matters for AI applications used on iOS devices.

## Multi-Tab and Multi-Window

**Playwright** natively supports multiple pages, tabs, and browser contexts in a single test. Useful for testing AI applications that open results in new tabs or use multiple windows.

**Cypress** does not support multi-tab testing. Workarounds exist but are limited.

**Winner: Playwright.**

## Developer Experience

**Cypress** has a visual test runner with time-travel debugging, automatic screenshots, and a built-in dashboard for test analytics. The learning curve is gentle, and the documentation is excellent.

**Playwright** has a trace viewer, codegen tool, and VS Code extension. The debugging experience is strong but requires more setup than Cypress's out-of-the-box experience.

**Winner: Cypress** for getting started quickly. Playwright for advanced debugging needs.

## Language Support

**Playwright** supports JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET.

**Cypress** supports JavaScript/TypeScript only.

**Winner: Playwright.** Python support is particularly relevant for AI teams whose backend is Python.

## CI Integration

Both integrate well with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and other CI platforms. Playwright supports test sharding for parallel execution across CI workers. Cypress offers a paid Dashboard service for parallelization and analytics.

**Winner: Tie.** Both work well in CI. Playwright's built-in sharding is free; Cypress's parallelization requires a paid plan.

## Recommendation

**Choose Playwright** for AI applications with streaming chat interfaces, SSE-based responses, or complex async workflows. Its network interception, multi-browser support, and Python API make it the stronger choice for most AI teams.

**Choose Cypress** for simpler AI applications with standard request-response patterns where developer experience and time-travel debugging are priorities. Cypress is easier to adopt for teams new to E2E testing.

For most AI-powered applications, Playwright is the better fit. The streaming response support and network interception flexibility address the specific challenges that AI UIs present.
