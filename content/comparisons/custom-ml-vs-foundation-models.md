The most common strategic question in AI projects is whether to build a custom model or use a foundation model. The framing has evolved: it used to be "build vs. buy a pre-trained model"; it is now "fine-tune a custom model vs. use a large foundation model with prompting." The right answer depends on your data situation, volume, accuracy requirements, and team capability.

## Foundation Models via Bedrock

Foundation models (Claude, Titan, Llama, Mistral) available through Amazon Bedrock are trained on massive datasets and perform well on a wide range of tasks out of the box. You access them via API, paying per token.

**Advantages:**
- No training data required - works immediately with prompting
- No model training cost or time - operational from day one
- Regular capability improvements from provider without your effort
- Handles novel tasks and edge cases via instruction following

**Disadvantages:**
- Per-token cost at scale - 1 million tokens processed daily at Sonnet rates is 3,000-5,000 EUR/month
- Latency - LLM inference is slower than purpose-built classifiers (100-500ms vs. 10-50ms)
- Output variability - generative models produce different outputs for the same input; determinism requires additional engineering
- Data privacy - your data is sent to a third-party API (Bedrock uses AWS infrastructure, but the data leaves your compute environment)

**Best fit:** Tasks requiring language understanding, generation, or reasoning. Varied or unpredictable inputs. Low to medium volume (under 100,000 complex calls/day). Situations where flexibility matters more than optimized cost.

## Custom ML on SageMaker

Training a purpose-built model on your own labeled data produces a model specialized for your specific task.

**Advantages:**
- Lower inference cost at scale - a deployed SageMaker endpoint for a small classifier costs 100-300 EUR/month regardless of volume
- Lower latency - small models respond in 5-20ms
- Full data control - training and inference run entirely in your AWS environment
- Deterministic outputs - classification models return consistent results
- Optimized accuracy for your specific use case when sufficient data exists

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires labeled training data - typically 1,000+ examples per class minimum, 10,000+ for strong performance
- Training time and cost - a moderately complex model takes hours to days to train and costs 50-500 EUR in compute
- Maintenance burden - models drift as input distribution changes; retraining is ongoing work
- Limited generalization - a custom classifier does exactly what it was trained for, nothing else
- Team capability requirement - building and maintaining SageMaker pipelines requires ML engineering skills

**Best fit:** High-volume classification, regression, or structured prediction tasks. Well-defined problem with a stable schema. Sufficient labeled training data. Team with ML engineering capability.

## The Hybrid Architecture

Most mature AI systems use both. The common pattern:

1. Foundation model during prototyping and for complex/rare cases
2. Foundation model generates training data labels for high-volume tasks
3. Custom model trained on those labels handles the volume
4. Foundation model serves as fallback when custom model confidence is low

This gives cost efficiency at scale while maintaining flexibility for edge cases. The custom model handles 80-90% of traffic at low cost; the foundation model handles the remaining 10-20% where it is needed.

## Decision Framework

| Factor | Points toward foundation model | Points toward custom model |
|---|---|---|
| Training data available | No | Yes (1,000+/class) |
| Daily volume | Low (<10,000 calls) | High (>100,000 calls) |
| Task definition | Fuzzy, reasoning-intensive | Well-defined, structured |
| Latency requirement | >200ms acceptable | <50ms required |
| Team ML capability | Limited | Strong |
| Timeline | Weeks | Months |
