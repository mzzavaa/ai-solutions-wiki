The multi-agent pattern - multiple LLM-powered agents collaborating on a task - has captured significant attention. But more agents does not mean better results. Understanding when a single agent suffices and when multi-agent architectures provide genuine value is critical for avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Overview

| Aspect | Single Agent | Multi-Agent |
|---|---|---|
| Complexity | Lower | Significantly higher |
| Latency | Lower (fewer LLM calls) | Higher (coordination overhead) |
| Cost | Lower | 2-10x higher token usage |
| Debugging | Straightforward | Complex conversation traces |
| Reliability | More predictable | More failure modes |
| Capability Breadth | Limited by context window | Broader through specialization |
| Best For | Focused, well-defined tasks | Complex, multi-domain tasks |

## How Single Agents Work

A single agent receives a task, reasons about it, uses tools as needed, and produces output. It maintains a single conversation context and makes all decisions within one LLM call chain. Modern LLMs with large context windows and tool use can handle surprisingly complex tasks within a single agent.

Single agents work well when the task domain is bounded, the required tools are related, and the reasoning chain does not exceed the model's effective context length. A code review agent, a customer support agent, or a data analysis agent can each handle substantial complexity as a single agent.

## How Multi-Agent Systems Work

Multi-agent systems divide work among specialized agents. Each agent has a focused role, specific tools, and a narrower system prompt. A coordinator (or conversation protocol) manages information flow between agents. Common patterns include supervisor (one agent delegates to specialists), debate (agents argue positions), pipeline (output of one feeds the next), and collaborative (agents converse freely).

## When Single Agents Break Down

Single agents struggle when the task requires expertise across unrelated domains simultaneously, when the tool set is too large for the model to select from reliably, when the conversation context grows beyond the model's effective reasoning window, or when different parts of the task need different model configurations (temperature, system prompts).

## When Multi-Agent Adds Value

Multi-agent architectures genuinely help when tasks require distinct expert perspectives (a security reviewer and a performance optimizer evaluating code), when the tool space is large enough that splitting it across agents improves tool selection accuracy, when you need adversarial checking (one agent proposes, another critiques), or when different subtasks benefit from different model configurations.

## The Complexity Cost

Multi-agent systems introduce coordination overhead, failure cascades, debugging complexity, and higher costs. Every agent-to-agent interaction is an opportunity for miscommunication. Conversation histories grow rapidly, increasing token costs. Debugging requires tracing conversations across multiple agents. Error handling must account for partial failures where some agents succeed and others fail.

## Decision Framework

Start with a single agent. Add agents only when you can identify a specific failure mode that a single agent cannot address. Common valid reasons to go multi-agent:

- **Tool overload**: Your agent has access to 20+ tools and struggles to select the right one
- **Context overflow**: The conversation exceeds the model's effective reasoning window
- **Role conflict**: The agent needs to both advocate for and critique a solution
- **Domain separation**: The task spans genuinely unrelated domains (legal + technical + financial)

Invalid reasons to go multi-agent: it sounds more sophisticated, you saw a demo, or you assume more agents means better quality.

## When to Choose Single Agent

Choose a single agent for most practical applications. Customer support, code generation, data analysis, content creation, and research tasks are typically well-served by a single well-prompted agent with appropriate tools. Start here and measure where it fails before adding complexity.

## When to Choose Multi-Agent

Choose multi-agent when you have demonstrated that a single agent cannot handle the task and you can identify the specific decomposition that multi-agent enables. Complex workflow automation, adversarial quality checking, and tasks requiring genuine multi-domain expertise are valid multi-agent use cases.

## Practical Recommendation

The best multi-agent system is one where each agent could function independently and the coordination adds measurable value. If removing one agent from your system does not noticeably change the output quality, that agent should not exist. Build the simplest architecture that meets your quality requirements and add agents only when measurement shows they improve outcomes.
