Kubernetes (via EKS) and Amazon ECS are both container orchestration platforms on AWS. For AI workloads, the choice affects GPU management, scaling behavior, ecosystem compatibility, and operational burden. This comparison focuses on AI-specific considerations.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | EKS (Kubernetes) | ECS |
|---|---|---|
| GPU support | Native (NVIDIA device plugin) | Native (GPU task definitions) |
| GPU sharing | Yes (time-slicing, MIG, MPS) | No (whole GPU per task) |
| Auto-scaling | HPA, VPA, Karpenter, KEDA | Service auto-scaling, capacity providers |
| ML ecosystem | Kubeflow, Ray, Seldon, KServe | SageMaker integration, custom |
| Operational complexity | High | Low to moderate |
| Multi-cloud portability | Yes | No (AWS only) |
| Serverless option | Fargate (no GPU) | Fargate (no GPU) |
| Spot/preemptible | Yes (Karpenter, Spot interruption handling) | Yes (capacity providers with Spot) |
| Cost | EKS control plane: $73/month + compute | No control plane cost + compute |

## GPU Management

**EKS** provides flexible GPU management through the NVIDIA device plugin and related tools:
- **GPU sharing.** Time-slicing allows multiple pods to share a single GPU. NVIDIA MIG (Multi-Instance GPU) on A100/H100 GPUs creates isolated GPU partitions. This is valuable when inference workloads do not need a full GPU.
- **GPU monitoring.** DCGM (Data Center GPU Manager) provides per-GPU metrics. Node labels expose GPU type and count for scheduling.
- **Mixed GPU types.** Different node groups can have different GPU types. Workloads are scheduled to appropriate GPUs based on node labels.

**ECS** has simpler GPU support:
- **Task-level GPU allocation.** Specify the number of GPUs per task in the task definition. ECS allocates whole GPUs.
- **No GPU sharing.** Each task gets exclusive access to allocated GPUs. Less efficient for small inference workloads that do not utilize a full GPU.
- **GPU monitoring.** Available through CloudWatch Container Insights.

For AI workloads that benefit from GPU sharing (multiple small models on one GPU), EKS is the better choice.

## ML Platform Ecosystem

EKS benefits from the Kubernetes ML ecosystem:

**Kubeflow** provides a complete ML platform on Kubernetes: notebooks, pipelines, training operators, model serving (KServe), and feature stores. It is the most comprehensive open-source ML platform.

**Ray** on Kubernetes provides distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, and model serving. Ray clusters on EKS scale dynamically based on workload.

**Seldon Core and KServe** provide sophisticated model serving with A/B testing, canary deployments, explainability, and multi-model serving.

**MLflow** can run on Kubernetes for experiment tracking and model registry.

ECS has a thinner ML ecosystem:
- Direct SageMaker integration for training and inference
- Custom-built ML pipelines using ECS tasks orchestrated by Step Functions
- Third-party tools deployed as ECS services

## Scaling for AI

**EKS** offers multiple scaling mechanisms:
- **Karpenter.** Provisioner that launches right-sized nodes (including GPU instances) based on pod requirements. Can respond to GPU demand in minutes.
- **KEDA.** Event-driven autoscaling based on custom metrics (inference queue depth, GPU utilization).
- **HPA.** Horizontal Pod Autoscaler scales based on CPU, memory, or custom metrics.

**ECS** scaling:
- **Service auto-scaling.** Scale based on CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, custom metrics).
- **Capacity providers.** Manage a pool of EC2 instances (including GPU) and scale based on reservation.
- Simpler to configure than EKS but less flexible.

## Operational Complexity

This is ECS's biggest advantage:

**ECS** is fully managed by AWS. No cluster upgrades, no control plane management, no plugin compatibility issues. The learning curve is moderate. IAM integration is native. CloudWatch integration is built-in.

**EKS** requires ongoing operational investment: cluster upgrades (quarterly), add-on management (CNI, CSI drivers, CoreDNS), security patching, RBAC configuration, and monitoring setup. The Kubernetes ecosystem is powerful but complex. Teams need Kubernetes expertise.

**Operational cost estimate:** A team managing EKS spends 10-20% of their time on cluster operations. ECS reduces this to 2-5%.

## Cost

**EKS:** $73/month for the control plane per cluster, plus compute (EC2 instances or Fargate). The control plane cost is fixed regardless of cluster size.

**ECS:** No control plane cost. Pay only for compute (EC2 instances or Fargate).

For AI workloads, compute costs dominate. The $73/month EKS control plane cost is negligible compared to GPU instance costs ($1-$30+ per hour per GPU instance). The real cost difference comes from utilization efficiency: EKS's GPU sharing can improve GPU utilization, which reduces the number of GPU instances needed.

## When to Choose EKS

- Need GPU sharing across multiple workloads
- Want to use Kubeflow, Ray, or KServe
- Building a sophisticated ML platform
- Need multi-cloud portability
- Team has Kubernetes expertise or is willing to invest in it
- Running many different AI workloads on shared infrastructure

## When to Choose ECS

- Want simplest operational path
- Team does not have Kubernetes expertise
- AI workloads are straightforward (training jobs, simple model serving)
- Using SageMaker for most ML tasks and need container orchestration for supporting services
- Cost of Kubernetes expertise is not justified by the workload

## Recommendation

For organizations making AI their core business with many models and workloads, EKS provides the ecosystem and flexibility to build a sophisticated ML platform. For organizations where AI is one of many workloads and operational simplicity is valued, ECS provides sufficient capability with significantly less overhead.
