A regional utility company serving 1.5 million customers operated a grid with 40,000 miles of distribution lines, 200 substations, and 15,000 transformers. Unplanned outages averaged 180 per month, with mean restoration time of 3.2 hours. Vegetation-related outages alone cost $8 million annually in emergency crew dispatch and customer impact.

## The Architecture

The system integrates sensor data, weather, vegetation analysis, and historical outage data to predict and prevent grid failures.

**Sensor network** - Smart grid sensors deployed at substations and critical junction points report voltage, current, power factor, and temperature every 30 seconds. Smart meters at customer premises provide last-mile visibility. Total sensor data volume exceeds 500 million readings per day, streamed to a time-series database.

**Anomaly detection layer** - Equipment-specific models monitor sensor readings for patterns that precede failures: transformer overload signatures, cable degradation indicators, and switching equipment anomalies. Each equipment type has a trained model based on historical failure data. The system generates early warnings 24-72 hours before predicted failures when patterns match known failure signatures.

**Vegetation risk model** - Satellite imagery (updated monthly) and LiDAR data (updated annually) feed a computer vision model that identifies vegetation encroachment on power lines. The model classifies each segment by risk level based on tree proximity, species (fast-growing species are higher risk), and historical trim dates. An LLM synthesizes the risk assessment into prioritized trim schedules.

**Weather impact prediction** - A model correlates weather forecasts with historical outage patterns to predict storm impact by grid segment. When severe weather is forecast, the system generates crew pre-positioning recommendations to minimize restoration time for predicted outage areas.

## Key Lessons

**Transformer failure prediction saved the most money.** Transformer replacements cost $15,000-50,000 each. Predicting failures and replacing transformers during planned maintenance windows (rather than emergency replacement after failure) saved 40% per incident in crew overtime, emergency logistics, and customer outage costs.

**False alarm management was region-specific.** Urban substations with highly variable loads generated more false anomaly alerts than rural substations with steady load profiles. The team implemented region-specific alert thresholds and noise filters, reducing urban false alarms by 60% without losing sensitivity to genuine anomalies.

**Vegetation management was the highest-ROI use case.** AI-prioritized vegetation trimming reduced vegetation-related outages by 35% in the first year by focusing trim crews on the highest-risk segments rather than following a fixed geographic rotation. The same trimming budget produced significantly better results through better targeting.

**Customer communication integration amplified value.** Connecting the outage prediction system to proactive customer notifications ("we are aware of potential service impacts in your area due to equipment maintenance") reduced inbound call volume during planned work by 50% and improved customer satisfaction scores during outage events.

## Results

Unplanned outages decreased from 180 to 125 per month. Mean restoration time improved from 3.2 hours to 2.1 hours through better crew pre-positioning. Vegetation-related outage costs decreased by $2.8 million annually. Transformer emergency replacement incidents decreased by 45%. Customer satisfaction scores improved by 12 points.
