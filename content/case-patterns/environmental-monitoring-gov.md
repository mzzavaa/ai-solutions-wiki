A state environmental protection agency was responsible for monitoring 4,500 permitted facilities and 12,000 miles of waterways for environmental compliance. With only 45 field inspectors, the agency could inspect each facility once every 3 years on average. Violations were typically discovered reactively through complaints or visible incidents rather than proactive monitoring.

## The Architecture

The system combines remote sensing, self-reported data analysis, and public complaint data to prioritize inspection resources.

**Remote sensing layer** - Satellite imagery (updated biweekly) is analyzed for visible environmental indicators: water discoloration near discharge points, vegetation health around industrial facilities, unauthorized land clearing, and illegal dumping at known problem sites. Air quality sensors deployed at 200 locations across the state report PM2.5, ozone, NOx, and SO2 levels every 15 minutes.

**Self-reported data analysis** - Permitted facilities submit discharge monitoring reports (DMRs), emissions reports, and waste manifests according to their permit schedules. An AI system analyzes these reports for anomalies: values near or exceeding permit limits, sudden changes in reported quantities, inconsistencies between related metrics (water intake vs. discharge volume), and late or missing submissions.

**Complaint integration** - Public complaints (phone, web, mobile app) are classified by type, severity, and location. An LLM reads complaint text to extract specific environmental concerns, affected resources (water, air, soil), and any evidence described. Complaints are geocoded and correlated with facility locations and permit data.

**Risk scoring engine** - Each facility receives a dynamic risk score based on: remote sensing indicators, self-reported data anomalies, complaint history, inspection history, violation history, facility age and type, and proximity to sensitive receptors (schools, hospitals, water sources, endangered species habitat). An LLM generates a risk narrative for each high-scoring facility explaining the contributing factors.

**Inspection prioritization** - Inspectors receive a prioritized facility list with risk scores, contributing factors, and suggested inspection focus areas. The system generates inspection plans that include: the specific concerns to investigate, relevant permit conditions, recent monitoring data, and any remote sensing imagery showing potential issues.

## Key Lessons

**Satellite imagery caught violations that self-reporting missed.** In the first year, satellite analysis identified 23 facilities with visible environmental impacts (water discoloration, unauthorized discharge) that were reporting compliance in their monitoring reports. This validated the value of independent monitoring beyond self-reported data.

**Complaint analysis revealed patterns invisible in individual reports.** Individual complaints about odor or noise seemed routine. But analyzing complaint patterns spatially and temporally - multiple complaints from the same area over several weeks - identified emerging problems before they became acute incidents. The pattern detection capability changed the agency's posture from reactive to proactive.

**Risk score calibration required enforcement outcome data.** The initial risk model assigned high scores based on theoretical risk factors. Calibrating the model against actual inspection findings (which high-scored facilities actually had violations) improved the targeting accuracy from 40% to 68% - meaning 68% of inspected high-risk facilities had confirmed violations.

**Inspector buy-in required demonstrating value, not mandating use.** Experienced inspectors had deep knowledge about their assigned facilities and initially resisted algorithmic prioritization. Providing the risk-scored list as "intelligence support" rather than "marching orders" and including inspectors' local knowledge as an input to the risk model gained adoption. Several inspectors reported that the system flagged facilities they had been concerned about but could not justify prioritizing under the old rotation-based schedule.

## Results

Violation detection rate increased from 22% to 38% of inspected facilities (indicating better targeting). Average time from violation occurrence to detection decreased by 45%. The number of significant environmental incidents (spills, unauthorized discharges) that were detected proactively (rather than reactively through complaints) increased from 12% to 40%. Inspector productivity improved by 20% through better preparation and targeted inspection plans. Public complaint resolution time decreased from 30 days to 12 days.
