A distribution company operating a 400,000-square-foot warehouse processing 25,000 order lines per day was struggling with declining productivity. As the product catalog grew from 8,000 to 15,000 SKUs, picking efficiency dropped 20% because fast-moving items were scattered across the warehouse and picking routes were inefficient. Labor costs were the largest operational expense, and overtime was running 30% over budget.

## The Architecture

The system optimizes three interconnected dimensions: product slotting (where items are stored), pick path optimization (how orders are fulfilled), and labor allocation (how many workers are needed when).

**Product slotting engine** - The slotting model analyzes order data to determine optimal product placement. Fast-moving items are slotted close to packing stations. Items frequently ordered together (co-occurrence analysis from order history) are slotted near each other. Heavy items are placed at ergonomic heights. The model re-evaluates slotting weekly and recommends moves when the expected efficiency gain exceeds the cost of relocating inventory.

**Pick path optimization** - When a batch of orders is released for picking, the optimization engine groups orders to minimize total travel distance. It considers picker starting location, item locations, weight constraints (heavy items first for pallet stability), and any special handling requirements (refrigerated items picked last). The engine produces pick sequences that minimize backtracking and empty travel.

**Labor allocation model** - A demand forecasting model predicts order volume by hour based on historical patterns, day of week, seasonal trends, and known events (sales, promotions). The labor allocation model converts volume forecasts into staffing requirements by role (pickers, packers, receivers, replenishers) and shift, accounting for productivity rates and break schedules.

**Real-time monitoring** - Warehouse management system events (order releases, pick completions, shipping confirmations) feed a real-time dashboard. An AI exception monitor detects anomalies: zones falling behind pace, unusually high error rates, and equipment bottlenecks. The system generates real-time rebalancing recommendations when workload distribution deviates from plan.

## Key Lessons

**Slotting optimization had the highest single impact.** Moving the top 500 fastest-moving SKUs to optimal locations (closest to pack stations, at waist height) reduced average pick travel distance by 28%. This single change, completed over two weekends, delivered 60% of the project's total productivity gain.

**Co-occurrence slotting reduced multi-item order time significantly.** Customers frequently ordered certain product combinations (e.g., a specific bracket always ordered with matching screws). Slotting co-occurring items in adjacent bins reduced the average multi-item order pick time by 18% because pickers could complete more items per aisle visit.

**Labor prediction accuracy improved when incorporating external data.** Adding weather forecasts (storms increase next-day order volume as people avoid stores) and competitor promotion calendars (competitor sales redirect demand) to the labor model improved daily volume prediction accuracy from 82% to 91%.

**Picker adoption required visible fairness.** The AI system assigned pick batches based on efficiency optimization, but pickers perceived the assignments as unfair (some batches had shorter walks than others). Adding a fairness constraint that ensured equal walk distances across pickers within each shift reduced productivity by 3% but improved picker satisfaction and eliminated grievances.

## Results

Overall warehouse productivity (lines picked per labor hour) improved by 32%. Overtime hours decreased by 55%. Average order fulfillment time decreased from 4.2 hours to 2.8 hours. Picking error rate decreased from 0.8% to 0.4% (fewer rushed picks due to better workload distribution). Annual labor cost savings exceeded $1.8 million.
