A municipal government building department processed 12,000 permit applications annually. Applications arrived as paper forms, PDFs, and email submissions with attached plans. Processing involved manual data entry, plan review checklist verification, fee calculation, and routing to appropriate reviewers. Average processing time from submission to initial review was 23 business days, with citizen complaints about delays being the department's top constituent concern.

## The Architecture

The system digitizes incoming applications, extracts structured data, performs preliminary compliance checks, and routes to reviewers with pre-populated review packages.

**Application intake** - All submission channels (counter drop-off, mail, email, web portal) funnel into a digital intake queue. Paper submissions are scanned at high resolution. The system identifies each document in the submission package: application form, site plan, floor plans, structural drawings, contractor licenses, and insurance certificates.

**Data extraction** - The application form is processed through document AI to extract applicant information, property details, project description, estimated cost, and requested permit type. The extraction layer handles the municipality's legacy form (unchanged since 1998) and the newer web-submitted form. Key extracted values include parcel number, zoning designation, project square footage, and contractor license number.

**Compliance pre-check** - Extracted data is checked against public records automatically: Is the parcel number valid? Is the zoning designation correct for the property? Is the contractor license active and valid for this work type? Does the project cost trigger additional review requirements? Is the property in a historic district, flood zone, or environmental overlay? Pre-checks that pass reduce reviewer workload; pre-checks that fail are flagged with specific issues.

**Reviewer routing** - Based on permit type, project complexity, and pre-check results, the application routes to the appropriate reviewer(s): building inspector, fire marshal, planning department, or environmental review. Each reviewer receives the application with extracted data pre-populated in the review system, relevant pre-check results, and a summary of the proposed work.

## Key Lessons

**Legacy form design was the biggest extraction challenge.** The paper form used small fonts, cramped fields, and ambiguous field labels. Applicants wrote outside the boxes, used abbreviations inconsistently, and left required fields blank. The extraction pipeline needed extensive post-processing rules specific to each form field's common failure modes.

**Compliance pre-checks had the highest citizen impact.** Previously, applications with basic errors (wrong parcel number, expired contractor license) sat in the review queue for weeks before a reviewer discovered the issue and returned the application. Automated pre-checks caught these errors on day one, reducing the average number of review cycles from 2.3 to 1.4.

**Integration with legacy systems required workarounds.** The municipality's property records system, zoning database, and license registry were separate systems with different APIs (and in one case, no API at all). Building integration adapters for each system took longer than building the AI pipeline itself. The team ultimately screen-scraped the license registry because getting API access through the procurement process would have taken 18 months.

**Phased deployment built trust with department staff.** The department was initially resistant to automation. Deploying the system as a "reviewer assistant" that pre-populated fields and flagged issues (rather than making decisions) allowed staff to verify and build confidence. After six months, staff actively requested additional automation for tasks they found tedious.

## Results

Average processing time from submission to initial review decreased from 23 to 8 business days. Data entry errors decreased by 75%. The percentage of applications requiring resubmission due to basic errors dropped from 35% to 12%. Citizen satisfaction scores improved from 2.8/5 to 4.0/5. The department handled a 15% increase in application volume without adding staff.
