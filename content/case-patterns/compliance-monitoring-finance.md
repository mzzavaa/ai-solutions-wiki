A financial institution with 3,000 employees was required by regulators to monitor employee communications and transactions for potential compliance violations: insider trading, market manipulation, conflicts of interest, and unauthorized outside business activities. The manual review team of 12 compliance analysts could review only 5% of communications, creating significant regulatory risk.

## The Architecture

The system monitors multiple data streams and uses AI to identify potential violations for human review.

**Data collection** - The system ingests email (200,000 per day), instant messages (500,000 per day), voice recordings (transcribed, 10,000 calls per day), and trade data (50,000 transactions per day). Data is captured from communication platforms via compliance archiving integrations and from trading systems via real-time feeds.

**Lexicon-based pre-filtering** - A fast, rule-based first pass flags communications containing keywords and phrases associated with compliance risk: code words for insider trading, references to personal trades, mentions of restricted securities, and language patterns associated with collusion. This reduces the volume requiring AI analysis by 85%.

**AI analysis layer** - Communications that pass pre-filtering are analyzed by an LLM for contextual compliance assessment. The model evaluates whether the flagged language indicates an actual compliance concern or is a false positive. "I need to dump this stock" in a conversation about a client portfolio rebalancing is different from the same phrase in a personal context. The model assesses: violation type probability, severity, and the specific regulatory rule potentially violated.

**Correlation engine** - The system correlates communication flags with trade data. A communication mentioning a specific company near the time of an unusual trade in that company's stock is a higher-priority alert than either signal alone. Cross-referencing across data streams catches patterns invisible in any single stream.

**Investigation workflow** - Prioritized alerts enter the compliance team's investigation queue with full context: the flagged communication, the AI assessment, any correlated trade data, the employee's compliance history, and the relevant regulatory rule. Investigators can expand the context to see surrounding communications and related activities.

## Key Lessons

**False positive reduction was the metric that mattered most.** The pre-AI system generated 500 alerts per day, of which 95% were false positives. Compliance analysts spent most of their time clearing false positives rather than investigating genuine concerns. The AI layer reduced false positives to 60%, cutting daily alert volume from 500 to 150 while maintaining the same true positive detection rate.

**Context was everything for communication analysis.** The same words in different contexts had entirely different compliance implications. Training the LLM with examples specific to financial services communications - including the types of false positive contexts it should recognize - was essential. Generic language models flagged too many routine business communications.

**Voice transcription quality affected analysis quality.** Phone call transcription accuracy was 85% on average, but compliance-relevant conversations often involved lowered voices, code words, and intentionally vague language. Building a financial services vocabulary and speaker adaptation improved transcription accuracy to 92% for compliance-critical calls.

**Cross-stream correlation caught the most serious violations.** The highest-severity findings (actual insider trading, front-running) were almost never detectable from communications alone - the violator was careful with language. But correlating communication timing with trade timing and personal account activity revealed patterns that neither data stream showed independently.

## Results

Communication monitoring coverage increased from 5% to 100%. False positive rate decreased from 95% to 60%, reducing daily analyst review from 500 to 150 alerts. True positive detection rate improved from an estimated 15% (sampling-based) to 78% (comprehensive monitoring). Three significant compliance violations were detected in the first year that would have been missed under the prior system. Regulatory examination findings related to surveillance completeness were eliminated.
