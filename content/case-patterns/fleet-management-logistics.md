A delivery logistics company operating a fleet of 500 vehicles across three metropolitan areas was experiencing rising operational costs: fuel expenses up 20% year-over-year, vehicle downtime averaging 8% of fleet capacity, and driver overtime consistently exceeding budget. The company deployed AI to optimize vehicle assignment, route efficiency, and maintenance scheduling.

## The Architecture

The system integrates telematics data, delivery demand, driver availability, and vehicle health to make real-time operational decisions.

**Telematics platform** - Every vehicle transmits GPS location, speed, engine diagnostics (OBD-II data), fuel consumption, idle time, and harsh braking/acceleration events every 30 seconds. This data feeds into a real-time processing pipeline and a historical analytics store. The telematics data provides the ground truth for all optimization models.

**Vehicle assignment engine** - Each morning, the system matches available vehicles to the day's delivery routes based on: vehicle cargo capacity versus route package volume, vehicle fuel efficiency versus route distance, vehicle type restrictions (some deliveries require specific vehicle types), and vehicle location (minimize deadhead miles from depot to first stop).

**Route optimization** - Beyond basic shortest-path routing, the optimizer considers: delivery time windows, traffic predictions by time of day, driver familiarity with the area (experienced drivers in complex urban zones, newer drivers on simpler suburban routes), and real-time traffic updates for mid-route re-optimization.

**Predictive maintenance** - Vehicle health models analyze telematics data patterns that precede common failures: brake wear indicators from stopping patterns, transmission stress from driving behavior, battery degradation from voltage patterns, and tire wear from cornering data. The system generates maintenance recommendations 1-2 weeks before predicted issues, allowing scheduling during planned downtime.

**Driver performance coaching** - An LLM analyzes individual driver telematics data to identify fuel-wasting behaviors: excessive idling, aggressive acceleration, speeding, and suboptimal route adherence. Weekly coaching summaries are generated for each driver with specific, actionable suggestions and comparison against fleet averages.

## Key Lessons

**Fuel optimization was the quickest win.** Optimizing vehicle-to-route assignment for fuel efficiency (matching fuel-efficient vehicles to longer routes, larger vehicles to dense urban routes) reduced fleet fuel consumption by 12% within the first month. This required no driver behavior change - just better vehicle assignment.

**Driver coaching worked when framed as help, not surveillance.** The initial rollout positioned telematics monitoring as performance measurement, which drivers resented. Reframing it as coaching ("here's how to reduce your fatigue and improve your fuel bonus") and tying fuel savings to driver bonuses changed adoption completely. Fuel-efficient driving improved by 15% after the reframing.

**Predictive maintenance accuracy depended on vehicle age.** Newer vehicles with comprehensive OBD-II data produced accurate maintenance predictions (85% true positive rate). Older vehicles with limited sensor data produced unreliable predictions (55% true positive rate). The team implemented a tiered approach: predictive maintenance for vehicles under 5 years old, enhanced scheduled maintenance for older vehicles.

**Real-time re-routing had customer experience implications.** While re-routing drivers around traffic improved overall efficiency, it changed estimated delivery times that had already been communicated to customers. Integrating re-routing decisions with customer notification systems - proactively updating delivery windows when routes changed - maintained customer satisfaction despite the changes.

## Results

Fleet fuel costs decreased by 18%. Vehicle downtime decreased from 8% to 4.5% of fleet capacity through predictive maintenance. Driver overtime decreased by 25% through better route planning. On-time delivery rate improved from 91% to 96%. Total annual operational savings exceeded $3.2 million across the fleet.
