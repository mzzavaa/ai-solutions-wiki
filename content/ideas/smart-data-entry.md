Data entry errors cost organizations an estimated 15-25% of revenue through downstream effects: incorrect invoices, wrong shipments, compliance violations, and flawed analytics. Traditional validation rules catch format errors but miss semantic ones.

## The Problem

Rule-based validation can check that a phone number has the right number of digits, but it cannot tell you that the city and zip code do not match, or that a customer name looks like it was accidentally pasted from another field. Semantic errors pass validation but cause problems downstream.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can evaluate data entries holistically, checking for internal consistency, plausibility, and completeness. It can flag entries that are technically valid but semantically suspect - like a shipping address in Alaska for a same-day delivery order.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Capture context.** When a form is submitted, collect all field values along with any available context (account history, related records, typical values for this record type).

**Step 2 - AI validation.** Send the form data to an LLM with instructions to check for inconsistencies, implausible values, and missing information. The model returns a list of potential issues ranked by severity.

**Step 3 - Inline feedback.** Display warnings to the user before submission, allowing them to correct issues or confirm intentional values. Log all flagged items for quality monitoring.

## Where It Breaks

High-volume data entry cannot afford the latency of an LLM call per submission. Very domain-specific data (chemical formulas, engineering specifications) requires specialized knowledge the model may lack. False positive warnings slow down experienced users.

## The Production Path

Use the AI validation selectively: on high-value records, new customer entries, or fields with historically high error rates. Cache common validation patterns to reduce API calls. Implement a "trust score" for experienced users that reduces warning frequency.
