Legal teams are bottlenecks in every organization. Contract review queues stretch to weeks because every agreement needs a lawyer's eyes, even when 80% of the contract is standard boilerplate that has been reviewed hundreds of times before.

## The Problem

Most contracts are 90% standard terms and 10% negotiated variations. But identifying which clauses deviate from your standard template requires reading the entire document carefully. Legal teams spend most of their review time confirming that standard clauses are unchanged rather than analyzing the variations that actually matter.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can compare an incoming contract against your standard template and highlight deviations: modified clauses, missing provisions, and non-standard language. This focuses legal review on the 10% that actually needs human judgment.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Template baseline.** Load your standard contract templates with annotations marking each clause's purpose and acceptable variation ranges.

**Step 2 - Deviation analysis.** Pass the incoming contract and your standard template to an LLM. The model produces a clause-by-clause comparison highlighting: unchanged clauses (skip), modified clauses (review), missing clauses (flag), and added clauses (review).

**Step 3 - Risk-scored report.** Generate a review report that scores each deviation by risk level (low, medium, high) based on the nature of the change. Route the report to the legal team with high-risk deviations highlighted.

## Where It Breaks

Subtle legal language changes that materially alter meaning may not be flagged if the wording is superficially similar. The model cannot assess the business implications of contractual changes. Jurisdiction-specific legal requirements need specialized knowledge.

## The Production Path

Train the system on your historical contract reviews - which deviations were accepted, which were rejected, and which required negotiation. This builds institutional knowledge into the risk scoring model. Always position the tool as a prioritization aid, not a legal decision-maker.
