Customer feedback is one of the most valuable inputs for product teams, but it arrives in fragments across support tickets, app reviews, survey responses, social media, and sales call notes. Synthesizing it manually means someone spends hours reading and tagging individual items.

## The Problem

Feedback volume grows faster than a product team's ability to process it. Important signals get buried in noise. The same issue reported 50 different ways looks like 50 separate problems instead of one critical theme. Without consistent categorization, trend analysis is impossible.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read individual feedback items and assign consistent categories (bug report, feature request, usability complaint, praise), extract the specific product area mentioned, and assess sentiment and urgency. Aggregating these classifications reveals trends that are invisible in raw feedback.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Aggregate sources.** Pull feedback from all channels into a single stream: support tickets via API, app store reviews via scraping, survey responses via export, and social mentions via monitoring tools.

**Step 2 - Classify each item.** Send each feedback item to an LLM with your product taxonomy and category definitions. The model returns: category, product area, sentiment score, and a one-line summary.

**Step 3 - Trend dashboard.** Aggregate classifications into a dashboard showing top themes, sentiment trends over time, and emerging issues. Alert the product team when a new theme crosses a volume threshold.

## Where It Breaks

Feedback that spans multiple categories needs multi-label classification. Sarcasm and cultural context can mislead sentiment analysis. Very short feedback ("it's broken") lacks enough context for accurate categorization.

## The Production Path

Start with your highest-volume feedback channel to prove value quickly. Add channels incrementally. Build a weekly automated digest for product managers with the top five emerging themes and supporting quotes.
