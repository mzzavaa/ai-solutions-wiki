Legacy code migration is tedious and expensive. Upgrading a framework version across thousands of files, converting callback-based code to async/await, or migrating from one ORM to another involves repetitive transformations that are too nuanced for simple find-and-replace but too tedious for manual conversion.

## The AI Approach

LLMs can handle code transformation tasks that follow patterns. Feed the model examples of before-and-after code for your specific migration, then let it transform files in bulk. The model handles the nuances that regex-based tools miss: renaming variables to match new conventions, updating import paths, and adjusting function signatures.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Define the migration** - Write 5-10 examples of manual migrations you have already done. These before/after pairs become the few-shot examples in your prompt.
2. **Batch transform** - For each file that needs migration, send it to the LLM along with your examples and instructions. Collect the transformed output.
3. **Validate** - Run the test suite against each transformed file. Flag files where tests fail for human review. Files that pass tests can be committed directly.

## Where It Breaks

Migrations that require understanding cross-file dependencies are harder. The model sees one file at a time and may miss that a renamed function is called from dozens of other files. Complex business logic embedded in legacy patterns may be transformed syntactically but lose semantic correctness.

## The Production Path

Build a pipeline that processes files in dependency order, tracks which files have been migrated, and maintains a dashboard of migration progress. Pair AI transformation with comprehensive test coverage - the tests are your safety net. Plan for human review of the 10-20% of files where automated migration produces incorrect results.
