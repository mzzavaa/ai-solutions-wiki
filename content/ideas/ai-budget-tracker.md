Budget tracking is reactive by default. Finance teams discover variances weeks after they occur, during the monthly close process. By then, corrective action is too late for the current period.

## The Problem

Budget owners get a spreadsheet showing planned versus actual spending, but interpreting variances requires context. Is a 15% overspend in marketing due to an approved campaign acceleration or an unplanned cost overrun? The numbers alone do not tell the story, and someone has to investigate each significant variance manually.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze budget variance data alongside contextual information (approved change orders, known commitments, seasonal patterns) to generate explanations for significant variances and predict end-of-period outcomes based on current run rates.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data integration.** Pull planned budget, actual spending, and committed but not yet invoiced amounts from your financial system. Include any approved budget adjustments or change orders.

**Step 2 - Variance analysis.** Send the data to an LLM with historical spending patterns and known context. The model identifies significant variances, proposes explanations based on available context, and flags unexplained deviations for investigation.

**Step 3 - Forecast and alert.** Project end-of-period outcomes based on current run rates. Alert budget owners when projected spending will exceed budget by more than a defined threshold, early enough to take corrective action.

## Where It Breaks

The model can only explain variances using data it has access to. Spending coded to the wrong cost center creates false variances the model cannot diagnose. Accrual timing differences between systems produce phantom variances.

## The Production Path

Start with the top 10 cost centers by budget size. Validate AI-generated explanations against finance team analysis for two cycles before trusting them. Integrate with your approval workflow to automatically include approved changes as context.
