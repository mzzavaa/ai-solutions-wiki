Open-ended survey questions produce the richest insights but are the hardest to analyze. Most organizations either skip open-ended questions entirely or collect responses that nobody reads because manual analysis does not scale.

## The Problem

A customer satisfaction survey with 2,000 responses and one open-ended question produces 2,000 text responses that need to be read, categorized, and summarized. Manual coding takes 20-40 hours. Most teams sample 50-100 responses and extrapolate, missing important minority themes.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read every response, assign thematic codes, extract sentiment, and produce a summary report that represents the full dataset rather than a biased sample. It handles thousands of responses as easily as dozens.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data preparation.** Export survey responses with any relevant metadata (customer segment, region, satisfaction score). Clean obvious junk responses (empty, test entries).

**Step 2 - Thematic coding.** Send responses in batches to an LLM. For each response, the model assigns one or more theme codes, sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), and extracts specific examples or suggestions. Use a consistent code list across batches for comparability.

**Step 3 - Synthesis report.** Aggregate coded responses into a theme frequency report with representative quotes for each theme. Highlight themes that correlate with low satisfaction scores as priority issues.

## Where It Breaks

Very short responses ("fine", "ok") lack enough content for reliable theme assignment. Sarcasm is difficult to detect. The model may create overly granular or inconsistent theme categories across batches without careful prompt design.

## The Production Path

Define your theme taxonomy before processing to ensure consistency. Run the analysis immediately after survey close to deliver insights while they are still actionable. Compare AI-generated themes against a small manually coded sample to validate accuracy.
