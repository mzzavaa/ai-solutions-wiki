Code review is essential but creates bottlenecks. Senior engineers spend hours reviewing pull requests, and much of that time goes to catching style violations, missing error handling, and obvious bugs that a machine could flag. The high-judgment review work gets less attention because the mechanical review work takes so long.

## The Problem

Pull requests sit in review queues for hours or days. When reviews happen, 60% of comments are about style, naming, or simple logic issues. Reviewers experience fatigue, and important architectural concerns get less attention because the reviewer already spent their energy on low-level issues.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read a pull request diff and provide structured feedback on code quality, potential bugs, security issues, and adherence to team conventions. This first-pass review happens in seconds and catches the mechanical issues, freeing human reviewers to focus on design and correctness.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - PR integration.** Set up a webhook or CI step that triggers on new pull requests. Extract the diff and any relevant context (linked issue, description, modified file paths).

**Step 2 - AI review.** Send the diff to an LLM with your team's coding standards and common review checklist as context. The model returns categorized feedback: bugs, style issues, security concerns, and suggestions.

**Step 3 - Comment posting.** Post AI-generated review comments on the pull request via your Git platform's API. Mark them clearly as AI-generated so human reviewers know to prioritize their own judgment.

## Where It Breaks

The model may flag valid patterns as issues if it does not understand your codebase conventions. False positives erode trust quickly. Large diffs exceed context window limits, requiring chunking strategies that can miss cross-file issues.

## The Production Path

Start with a narrow scope - security checks and common bug patterns only. Expand to style and convention checks after calibrating false positive rates. Add a thumbs-up/thumbs-down mechanism on AI comments to improve relevance over time.
