Creating a presentation from scratch typically takes 2-6 hours: outlining the narrative, writing slide content, finding data to support points, and formatting. Most of this work is structural and repetitive, making it a strong candidate for AI acceleration.

## The Problem

Presentation creation is high-effort, low-creativity work for most business contexts. The author knows what they want to say but spends most of their time on structure, wording, and formatting rather than refining the actual message. Starting from a blank slide deck is the hardest part.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can take a brief, document, or set of bullet points and generate a structured slide outline with content for each slide. The output includes slide titles, bullet points, speaker notes, and suggestions for data visualizations.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Input processing.** Accept input as a text brief, document, or meeting notes. If the input is a long document, have the LLM extract the key messages and supporting points first.

**Step 2 - Slide generation.** Prompt the LLM to create a slide-by-slide outline following your organization's presentation structure (situation, complication, resolution or similar framework). Include speaker notes for each slide.

**Step 3 - Format and output.** Convert the structured output into a slide deck using a template via the Google Slides API or python-pptx library. Apply your brand template automatically.

## Where It Breaks

The model produces generic business language without strong input about audience and context. Data-heavy presentations need real data that the model cannot fabricate. Visual design and layout are beyond current text model capabilities.

## The Production Path

Provide the model with your best existing presentations as style examples. Add a library of approved data visualizations and chart templates. Focus on the 80% structural work and leave the 20% creative polish to humans.
