Generic nurture sequences treat every lead the same. A CEO evaluating a strategic platform and an individual contributor exploring tools get identical emails on identical schedules. This one-size-fits-all approach produces low engagement and wasted marketing spend.

## The Problem

Marketing automation platforms can send personalized emails, but someone has to write the variants and define the branching logic. Most teams create 2-3 segments at best, which barely scratches the surface of meaningful personalization. The result is content that is technically "personalized" (includes the recipient's name) but substantively generic.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can generate genuinely personalized nurture content based on what you know about each lead: their industry, role, company size, content they have engaged with, and stage in the buying process. Each email is drafted specifically for that prospect's context.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Lead enrichment.** Aggregate data about each lead: form submissions, content downloads, page visits, company information (industry, size, tech stack from enrichment tools), and any CRM notes.

**Step 2 - Content generation.** For each lead, prompt the LLM with their profile and your content library. The model selects the most relevant piece of content to share next and drafts an email that connects that content to the lead's specific situation.

**Step 3 - Sequence orchestration.** Queue personalized emails in your marketing automation platform. Adjust timing based on engagement: leads who open and click get accelerated sequences; leads who do not engage get longer intervals and different approaches.

## Where It Breaks

Hyper-personalization can feel creepy if it references information the lead did not knowingly provide. AI-generated emails that feel too formulaic undermine the personalization intent. Without enough data, personalization defaults to generic, making the effort pointless.

## The Production Path

Start with your highest-value lead segment where the ROI of personalization justifies the effort. A/B test AI-personalized sequences against your current generic sequences to measure lift. Scale to broader segments as results prove out.
