Users ignore most notifications. Push notifications sent at the wrong time get dismissed. Emails about urgent matters sit unread. Slack messages during deep work break concentration. The one-size-fits-all approach to notifications - send everything immediately via the default channel - fails both the user and the sender.

## The AI Approach

An AI system learns each user's notification preferences from their behavior: when they typically read messages, which channels they respond to fastest, and which notification types they engage with versus dismiss. It uses these patterns to route each notification through the optimal channel at the optimal time.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Track engagement** - Log when notifications are sent, when they are opened, and whether the user takes action. Record the channel (email, push, Slack, in-app), time of day, and notification type.
2. **Learn preferences** - For each user, build a profile of their responsiveness by channel, time of day, and notification category. Some users read emails at 9 AM, others check Slack throughout the day, others only respond to push notifications.
3. **Route intelligently** - For each outgoing notification, select the channel and timing most likely to result in engagement based on the user's profile and the notification's urgency. Urgent notifications override timing preferences.

## Where It Breaks

Users' habits change and the model can lag behind. Overly aggressive optimization can feel manipulative. Some notifications must be sent immediately regardless of engagement optimization (security alerts, password resets).

## The Production Path

Start with timing optimization only, holding channel constant. Measure the impact on open rates and action rates. Then introduce channel selection. Always provide users with explicit preference controls that override the AI's decisions. Respect do-not-disturb hours absolutely.
