Supply chain disruptions cost companies an average of 45% of one year's profits over the course of a decade. Most disruptions are foreseeable - weather events, port congestion, supplier financial distress - but the warning signs are scattered across sources that nobody monitors systematically.

## The Problem

A factory fire at a key supplier, a port closure due to weather, or a geopolitical event affecting a shipping route can halt your operations. By the time you learn about it through normal channels, competitors have already secured alternative supply and shipping capacity is scarce.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can monitor news feeds, weather data, shipping tracker APIs, and supplier financial filings to identify events that could disrupt your specific supply chain. It maps events to your supplier network and shipping routes, alerting only when a disruption affects your operations.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Supply chain mapping.** Document your critical suppliers, their locations, your shipping routes, and alternative sources for key materials. This map is the context the AI needs to assess relevance.

**Step 2 - Event monitoring.** Set up monitoring for news (supplier names, key regions), weather (supplier and shipping route locations), shipping data (port congestion, vessel tracking), and financial data (supplier credit ratings, earnings reports).

**Step 3 - Impact assessment.** When a relevant event is detected, send it to an LLM with your supply chain map. The model assesses: which suppliers or routes are affected, estimated impact timeline, and recommended mitigation actions (activate alternative supplier, expedite current orders, increase safety stock).

## Where It Breaks

Not all disruptions are predictable from public information. Supplier sub-tier dependencies (your supplier's suppliers) are often invisible. False alarms from news events that sound relevant but have no actual impact on your supply chain.

## The Production Path

Start with your single most critical supply chain. Validate alert relevance over three months before expanding coverage. Build response playbooks for common disruption scenarios so alerts trigger action, not just awareness.
