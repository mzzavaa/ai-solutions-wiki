Recruiters spend 6-8 seconds per resume during initial screening, which means important qualifications get missed and unconscious biases influence decisions. For high-volume roles receiving hundreds of applications, this problem compounds.

## The Problem

Resume screening is simultaneously tedious and consequential. Recruiters scan for keyword matches rather than holistic fit because volume demands speed. Qualified candidates with non-traditional backgrounds or unusual resume formats get filtered out. The process is inconsistent across recruiters.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read each resume in full, compare qualifications against structured job requirements, and produce a fit score with detailed rationale. Unlike keyword matching, the model understands that "led a team of 12" is relevant to a leadership requirement even if the word "manager" never appears.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Requirements structuring.** Convert the job description into a structured requirements list with must-have and nice-to-have qualifications, weighted by importance.

**Step 2 - Resume analysis.** For each resume, send it to the LLM with the structured requirements. The model returns a fit score and a per-requirement assessment explaining how the candidate meets or does not meet each criterion.

**Step 3 - Ranked shortlist.** Present a ranked candidate list with scores and rationale. Include a "review recommended" flag for candidates who scored borderline, ensuring edge cases get human attention.

## Where It Breaks

AI screening can perpetuate historical biases present in the job requirements or scoring criteria. The model may undervalue non-linear career paths or unconventional credentials. Legal requirements around hiring fairness vary by jurisdiction and must be carefully considered.

## The Production Path

Always position AI screening as a prioritization tool, not a rejection mechanism. Include bias auditing by regularly analyzing whether the model's rankings correlate with protected characteristics. Have human recruiters review all rejections above a minimum score threshold.
