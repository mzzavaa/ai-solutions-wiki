Email templates save time but feel robotic. Fully custom responses are personal but slow. The sweet spot is a system that drafts a contextual response using the right template as a starting point, adapted to the specific situation described in the incoming email.

## The Problem

Customer-facing teams maintain libraries of template responses, but finding the right template and customizing it for each email takes 5-10 minutes. New team members spend even longer because they do not know which templates exist or which applies to a given situation.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read an incoming email, match it to the most relevant template from your library, and generate a customized draft that incorporates specific details from the customer's message. The result reads like a personally written response but takes seconds to generate.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Template library.** Compile your best email responses into a template library with category tags. Include 10-20 high-quality examples covering your most common response scenarios.

**Step 2 - Contextual drafting.** When an email arrives, pass it to an LLM along with the template library. The model selects the best-fit template, incorporates details from the incoming email, and generates a draft response.

**Step 3 - One-click send.** Present the draft to the agent for review and editing. Track edit distance between draft and sent version to measure how much value the automation provides.

## Where It Breaks

Highly emotional or escalated emails need human empathy that templates cannot provide. Technical questions requiring investigation cannot be answered from templates alone. Multi-issue emails that span several template categories need careful handling.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your email client or helpdesk platform. Build a feedback loop where agents rate draft quality, and use that data to improve template selection and customization. Add tone adjustment (formal, friendly, apologetic) based on the incoming message's sentiment.
