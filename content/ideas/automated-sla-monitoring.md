SLA breaches are usually discovered after the fact. The monthly report shows 99.2% uptime against a 99.9% SLA, and by then it is too late. Reactive SLA monitoring tells you what already went wrong. Predictive monitoring tells you what is about to go wrong in time to prevent it.

## The AI Approach

An AI system continuously tracks SLA-relevant metrics, calculates remaining error budget in real time, and predicts whether current trends will lead to a breach before the measurement period ends. When a breach is likely, it alerts the team with time to intervene.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Define SLAs** - Enumerate your SLAs with their metrics, thresholds, and measurement windows. For each, identify the underlying monitoring data (uptime checks, latency percentiles, error rates).
2. **Track and project** - Continuously calculate current SLA compliance and remaining error budget. Use trend analysis to project whether the error budget will be exhausted before the measurement window closes.
3. **Alert and recommend** - When the projected SLA compliance drops below a safety margin, alert the responsible team. Include which specific incidents or degradations are consuming error budget and suggest actions to prevent a breach.

## Where It Breaks

Predictions based on current trends assume conditions remain similar. A single major incident can consume the entire remaining error budget in hours. The system should account for both gradual degradation and sudden failure scenarios.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your monitoring stack and incident management system. Provide a real-time dashboard showing SLA status and error budget consumption. Tie SLA predictions to change management - flag high-risk deployments when error budget is low. Report weekly to stakeholders with breach probability assessments.
