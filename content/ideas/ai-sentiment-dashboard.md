Sentiment surveys capture a snapshot every quarter. By the time results are analyzed and acted upon, the situation has changed. Real-time sentiment monitoring catches shifts as they happen, enabling rapid response to emerging problems.

## The Problem

Quarterly engagement surveys and periodic NPS measurements tell you how people felt weeks ago. Sentiment can shift rapidly due to product issues, policy changes, or market events. Without continuous monitoring, you are always reacting to old data.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can continuously analyze text from customer interactions (support tickets, chat transcripts, social mentions) and employee communications (survey comments, feedback channels) to produce a real-time sentiment score with topic-level breakdown.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Stream setup.** Connect to text sources in real-time or near-real-time: support ticket creation events, chat transcript feeds, social media monitoring streams, and internal feedback channels.

**Step 2 - Continuous analysis.** Process each text item through an LLM to extract sentiment (positive, negative, neutral with intensity score), topic classification, and key phrases. Aggregate scores over rolling windows (hourly, daily, weekly).

**Step 3 - Dashboard and alerts.** Build a dashboard showing sentiment trends by topic, channel, and customer segment. Set alerts for significant sentiment drops (more than one standard deviation below rolling average).

## Where It Breaks

Sentiment analysis at scale requires cost management - sending every message to a large model is expensive. A lightweight classifier for most messages with LLM escalation for ambiguous ones balances cost and accuracy. Cultural and contextual language variations affect accuracy.

## The Production Path

Start with one high-volume channel to validate the approach. Use a tiered model strategy: fast, cheap classification for most messages, with full LLM analysis for edge cases. Build actionable response playbooks so sentiment alerts trigger investigation, not just awareness.
