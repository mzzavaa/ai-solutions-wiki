Missed deadlines are rarely surprises to the people doing the work. They are only surprises to managers who relied on green status indicators until it was too late. The signals that a deadline is at risk are usually visible weeks in advance.

## The Problem

Status reports say "on track" until they suddenly say "delayed." This binary reporting hides the gradual accumulation of risk: scope creep, blocked dependencies, declining velocity, and increasing bug counts all signal trouble before a deadline is missed.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze project data - remaining work, current velocity, dependency status, and historical patterns for similar projects - to predict which deadlines are at risk and how much buffer remains. Early warning enables course correction.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Project data collection.** Pull current task status, completion velocity (tasks per week), remaining scope, blocking issues, and the deadline date from your project management tool.

**Step 2 - Risk prediction.** Send the data to an LLM with historical project data showing how similar scope and velocity combinations resulted in on-time or late delivery. The model predicts delivery probability and identifies the primary risk factors.

**Step 3 - Early warning alerts.** Generate alerts when delivery probability drops below 80%, including specific risk factors and suggested mitigations (scope reduction, resource addition, dependency escalation).

## Where It Breaks

Project management data reflects reported status, not actual progress. Teams that do not update tickets regularly produce unreliable predictions. The model cannot account for heroic efforts or organizational interventions that change the trajectory.

## The Production Path

Calibrate predictions against actual outcomes for two quarters before relying on them for decision-making. Focus on large projects with well-tracked tasks first. Use predictions to prompt conversations rather than trigger automated responses.
