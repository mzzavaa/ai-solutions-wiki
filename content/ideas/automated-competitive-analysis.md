Keeping up with competitor activity is important but rarely urgent, which means it consistently falls to the bottom of the priority list. By the time someone does a competitive review, the information is weeks old.

## The Problem

Competitive intelligence requires monitoring multiple sources: competitor websites, press releases, job postings, social media, review sites, and industry publications. Doing this manually for even three or four competitors takes hours per week and produces inconsistent coverage.

## The AI Approach

Automated web monitoring can track changes to competitor websites, new press releases, and social mentions. An LLM synthesizes these signals into a structured weekly brief highlighting what changed, what it might mean, and what your team should watch.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Source monitoring.** Set up RSS feeds, web change detection, and social listening for each competitor. Aggregate raw signals into a daily feed.

**Step 2 - AI synthesis.** Pass the weekly signal collection to an LLM with context about your company's positioning and priorities. The model produces a structured brief: new product announcements, pricing changes, hiring signals, partnership news, and customer sentiment shifts.

**Step 3 - Distribute.** Send the brief to stakeholders via email or Slack on a weekly cadence. Include source links for anything that warrants deeper reading.

## Where It Breaks

Public information is inherently lagging. Competitors announce after they have already acted. The model may over-interpret minor website changes as strategic signals. Paywalled industry reports are inaccessible to automated monitoring.

## The Production Path

Add a feedback mechanism where recipients flag which insights were useful. Use this to tune the model's emphasis over time. Expand source coverage gradually as you learn which signals matter most for your market.
