A misconfigured autoscaling policy, a forgotten GPU instance, or a sudden spike in API calls can add thousands of dollars to your cloud bill before anyone notices. Monthly cost reviews catch these issues too late. By the time someone looks at the bill, the damage is done.

## The AI Approach

An AI system monitors cloud spending data in near real time, learns normal spending patterns, and alerts when costs deviate significantly. Unlike simple threshold alerts, it understands that spending increases on Monday mornings are normal but the same increase on a Saturday night is not.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Ingest costs** - Pull cost and usage data from your cloud provider's billing API (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing, Azure Cost Management). Aggregate by service, team, and tag.
2. **Learn patterns** - Establish baselines for normal spending patterns including daily, weekly, and monthly cycles. Flag deviations that exceed a dynamic threshold (percentage above the expected value for this time window).
3. **Alert with context** - When an anomaly is detected, use an LLM to analyze the cost breakdown and generate a plain-language explanation: which service spiked, which account or team owns it, and what likely caused the increase.

## Where It Breaks

Legitimate cost increases from planned events (load tests, marketing campaigns, new feature launches) trigger false alarms. Maintaining a calendar of expected cost events reduces noise. Early in deployment, the model lacks enough history to establish accurate baselines.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your FinOps platform. Send alerts to the team that owns the spending via Slack or PagerDuty. Include one-click acknowledgment for expected increases. Track savings from early detection of genuine anomalies to demonstrate ROI.
