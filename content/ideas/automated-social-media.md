Marketing teams often spend hours repurposing a single blog post or announcement into platform-specific social media content. Each platform has different character limits, tone expectations, and formatting conventions. Doing this manually for every piece of content is a bottleneck.

## The Problem

A product launch requires posts for LinkedIn, X, Instagram, and internal channels - each with different framing, length, and hashtag conventions. A single person drafting all variants spends 30-45 minutes per source piece. For teams publishing daily, this adds up quickly.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can take source content (blog post, press release, product update) and generate platform-specific drafts that match your brand voice. By providing examples of past successful posts as context, the model learns your tone, emoji usage, and hashtag patterns.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Source ingestion.** Feed the source content (blog post URL, press release text, or product brief) to the system.

**Step 2 - Multi-platform generation.** Prompt the LLM with platform-specific instructions and 3-5 examples of your best-performing posts per platform. Generate drafts for each target platform in a single call.

**Step 3 - Review queue.** Present drafts in a simple interface for human review and approval. Track which drafts are accepted as-is versus edited, to improve prompt quality over time.

## Where It Breaks

AI-generated social content can sound generic without strong brand voice examples. Topical or humorous content requires cultural awareness the model may lack. Regulatory industries (finance, healthcare) need compliance review that the model cannot replace.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your social media management tool's API to push approved drafts directly to the publishing queue. Add A/B variant generation to test different angles for the same content.
