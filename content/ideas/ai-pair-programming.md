AI pair programming works best when you treat the AI as a collaborator with specific strengths and weaknesses, not as a code generator you paste prompts into. The most effective developers using AI assistants have developed patterns for when the AI leads and when the human leads.

## The AI Approach

Use AI as a pair programming partner in three modes: the AI drives (generating code while you review), you drive (writing code while the AI reviews), or collaborative (iterating together on a design or implementation).

## Three-Step Build

1. **AI drives** - Describe the desired behavior in detail, including edge cases and constraints. Let the AI generate an implementation. Review critically: does it handle errors? Is it testable? Does it match your codebase conventions?
2. **You drive** - Write the code yourself but use the AI for real-time review. Paste your function and ask "what bugs do you see?" or "how would you simplify this?" The AI catches issues fresh eyes would catch, but instantly.
3. **Collaborative design** - For architectural decisions, describe the problem and constraints. Ask the AI for multiple approaches with trade-offs. Use the discussion to sharpen your own thinking, then implement the approach you chose.

## Where It Breaks

Over-reliance on AI-generated code leads to codebases that the developer does not fully understand. The AI may produce plausible-looking code that has subtle logic errors. Developers who skip careful review because the code "looks right" introduce bugs they would not have written themselves.

## The Production Path

Establish team norms for AI pair programming: all AI-generated code gets the same review scrutiny as human code. Use AI assistance metrics (not to police usage, but to understand patterns). Share effective prompting patterns across the team so everyone benefits from what individuals discover.
