Every week, someone on your team manually pulls data from a dashboard, copies it into a slide deck or document, writes narrative commentary around the numbers, and sends it to leadership. This process takes 2-4 hours and produces a report that is stale by the time it is read.

## The Problem

Manual report creation is slow, error-prone, and boring. The narrative sections tend to be formulaic ("revenue increased 3% week-over-week") because the author is focused on accuracy rather than insight. Charts are reformatted every cycle. The same report structure is rebuilt from scratch each time.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can take structured data (metrics, KPIs, time series) and generate narrative analysis that highlights notable trends, anomalies, and comparisons. Combined with a templated report structure, the system produces a complete report draft with both data visualization and written commentary.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data pull.** Automate data extraction from your analytics platform, data warehouse, or API. Structure the output as a JSON payload with current period, prior period, and target values for each metric.

**Step 2 - Narrative generation.** Pass the structured data to an LLM with instructions to identify the three most important trends, explain any anomalies, and suggest one action item. Include a sample report for tone and style reference.

**Step 3 - Report assembly.** Combine the AI-generated narrative with auto-generated charts into your report template (Google Slides, PDF, or email format). Distribute on schedule.

## Where It Breaks

The model may highlight statistically insignificant variations as important trends. It cannot explain root causes it does not have context for - a revenue dip caused by a billing system outage requires operational context the model lacks.

## The Production Path

Add a human review step for the first month to calibrate narrative quality. Include contextual notes (known events, planned changes) as LLM input to improve the relevance of commentary. Automate distribution via email or Slack on a fixed schedule.
