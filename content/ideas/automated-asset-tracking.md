IT asset management is a perpetual headache. Laptops, servers, licenses, and peripherals are tracked in spreadsheets that are out of date the moment they are created. Nobody knows exactly what they have, where it is, or when it needs to be replaced.

## The Problem

Asset lifecycle tracking requires knowing when each device was purchased, its warranty status, its current condition, and when it should be refreshed. With hundreds or thousands of assets, manual tracking means surprises: sudden warranty expirations, bulk refresh needs that blow the budget, and ghost assets that exist in the inventory but not in reality.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze asset data alongside vendor lifecycle announcements, warranty databases, and usage patterns to predict refresh needs, flag upcoming warranty expirations, and recommend optimal procurement timing.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Asset inventory sync.** Pull current asset data from your CMDB, MDM platform, and procurement records. Enrich with vendor lifecycle data (end-of-life announcements, support timelines).

**Step 2 - Lifecycle analysis.** Send the asset inventory to an LLM with lifecycle policies and budget constraints. The model identifies: assets approaching end-of-life, warranty expirations in the next 90 days, clusters of assets that should be refreshed together for efficiency, and budget-optimized refresh schedules.

**Step 3 - Action recommendations.** Generate a monthly asset lifecycle report with prioritized actions: immediate replacements needed, upcoming refresh planning, and procurement recommendations including volume discount opportunities from batching.

## Where It Breaks

Asset data quality is typically poor - devices get reassigned without updating records, and personal devices blur the boundary of managed assets. Vendor lifecycle announcements may not cover all product lines. Budget constraints often override optimal timing.

## The Production Path

Start with a physical inventory reconciliation to establish accurate baseline data. Automate data collection through MDM and network discovery tools. Track actual vs. predicted refresh needs to improve forecasting accuracy over time.
