Meeting notes are one of the most universally disliked administrative tasks in any organization. Someone has to take them, they are often incomplete or delayed, and the person taking notes cannot fully participate in the meeting. AI-powered meeting summarization eliminates the manual work and typically produces better structured output than manual notes.

## The Problem

Manually written meeting notes have consistent failure modes: action items are buried in prose, decisions are not clearly separated from discussion, and the notes are often not written until hours or days after the meeting when context has faded. The result is a document that captures what was said but not what was decided or who is doing what by when.

For recurring meetings - standups, weekly reviews, project checkpoints - the overhead compounds. Thirty minutes of meeting generates 15 minutes of notes, which nobody reads.

## The AI Approach

Transcription converts speech to text in real time or from a recording. An LLM then applies structure to the transcript: identifying decisions, extracting action items with owners and due dates, summarizing discussion by topic, and flagging unresolved questions.

This is a task where LLMs perform reliably well. Meeting transcripts follow predictable conversational patterns, action items tend to use consistent linguistic markers ("I will", "can you", "let's make sure"), and summarization quality is easy to evaluate.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Transcribe the recording.** Amazon Transcribe converts audio files (MP3, MP4, WAV, or similar) to text with speaker diarization - it labels each turn with the speaker. Submit the recording to the `StartTranscriptionJob` API and poll for completion, or use Amazon Transcribe Call Analytics for real-time processing.

**Step 2 - Structure with an LLM.** Pass the transcript to a Bedrock model with a structured prompt requesting: (a) a three-sentence summary, (b) decisions made, (c) action items in the format "owner - task - due date", and (d) open questions that were not resolved. Return the output as JSON for easy downstream processing.

**Step 3 - Deliver and store.** Post the structured summary to your team's communication channel (Slack, Teams) and write the JSON to your knowledge base or project management tool. For recurring meetings, build a simple weekly digest that shows all action items from the past week and their completion status.

## Where It Breaks

Transcription accuracy degrades with heavy accents, overlapping speech, background noise, and domain-specific jargon or proper nouns. A post-processing correction step (ask the LLM to fix obvious transcription errors using context) helps, but for highly technical meetings with lots of specialized terminology, manual review of the transcript before summarization improves output quality.

The LLM may hallucinate action items that were implied but not stated, or miss items that were phrased ambiguously. Frame the action item extraction prompt conservatively: "extract only explicit commitments with a clear owner."

## The Production Path

For production use, integrate with your calendar system to automatically pull recordings from completed meetings. Add a feedback mechanism so meeting participants can correct missed action items, which creates a dataset for evaluating and improving prompt quality over time. Most teams see adoption increase sharply once the summary arrives in their communication channel within five minutes of the meeting ending.
