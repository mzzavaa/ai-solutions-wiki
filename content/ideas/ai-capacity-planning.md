Capacity planning is a guessing game in most organizations. Teams either over-provision (wasting money on idle resources) or under-provision (risking outages when demand spikes). The data to plan accurately exists in monitoring systems, but translating usage trends into procurement decisions requires analysis that rarely happens proactively.

## The Problem

Infrastructure teams are asked "do we have enough capacity for next quarter?" and answer based on gut feeling plus whatever monitoring data they can quickly pull. Growth is rarely linear, seasonal patterns are hard to account for, and new product launches create step-function demand changes that trend-based projections miss.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze historical resource utilization data, correlate it with business metrics (user growth, transaction volume), and produce capacity forecasts that account for trends, seasonality, and planned business events.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Utilization data collection.** Pull historical CPU, memory, storage, and network utilization from your monitoring platform. Include business metrics (active users, transactions, data volume) from the same time periods.

**Step 2 - Forecast generation.** Send the historical data to an LLM along with known upcoming events (product launches, marketing campaigns, seasonal peaks). The model projects resource utilization for the next 3-6 months and identifies when each resource type will hit capacity thresholds.

**Step 3 - Procurement timeline.** Based on forecasted capacity needs and procurement lead times, generate a timeline for capacity additions. Include cost estimates and alternative scenarios (e.g., optimize existing resources vs. add new capacity).

## Where It Breaks

Cloud auto-scaling handles many capacity concerns automatically, making this most valuable for resources with procurement lead times (hardware, reserved instances, licenses). Unprecedented growth patterns have no historical basis for prediction. The model cannot predict architectural changes that alter resource requirements.

## The Production Path

Compare AI forecasts against actual utilization monthly to calibrate accuracy. Focus on resources with the longest lead times and highest over-provisioning costs. Integrate with your cloud cost management tool to optimize reserved instance purchasing.
