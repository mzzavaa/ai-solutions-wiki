Project managers spend 2-3 hours per week compiling status reports by pulling data from Jira, reading Slack channels, checking Git commit logs, and synthesizing it all into a coherent update. The information exists - it just needs to be assembled.

## The Problem

Status information is scattered across multiple tools. Ticket status is in Jira, technical progress is in Git commits, blockers are mentioned in Slack threads, and decisions are buried in meeting notes. No single view shows the real project state, so someone has to manually piece it together.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can aggregate data from multiple project tools and produce a structured status summary that highlights progress, blockers, risks, and upcoming milestones. It reads the same sources a project manager would, but does it in seconds.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data aggregation.** Pull this week's data from project management tools (tickets completed, in progress, blocked), Git (commits, PRs merged), and communication channels (Slack messages mentioning the project).

**Step 2 - AI synthesis.** Feed the aggregated data to an LLM with your status report template. The model produces: summary of progress, key accomplishments, current blockers, risks, and next week's priorities.

**Step 3 - Review and send.** Present the draft to the project manager for a 5-minute review and edit. Distribute via email or post to the project's status channel.

## Where It Breaks

The model cannot assess qualitative factors like team morale or stakeholder satisfaction. Ticket status does not always reflect actual progress (a ticket marked "in progress" for two weeks might be stuck or might be complex). Slack messages require context to interpret correctly.

## The Production Path

Start with one project as a pilot. Compare AI-generated status reports against manually written ones for accuracy. Add custom data sources (deployment logs, test results) to improve completeness. Automate distribution on a weekly schedule.
