Invoice processing is one of the highest-ROI AI automation targets in finance operations. A typical accounts payable team spends 3-5 minutes per invoice on manual data entry: vendor name, invoice number, line items, totals, payment terms, due date. For an organization processing 500 invoices per month, that is 25-40 hours of manual work - most of it repetitive and error-prone.

## The Problem

Invoices arrive in multiple formats: PDF, scanned image, email attachment, EDI feed. Each vendor has a different layout. Fields appear in different positions, use different labels, and sometimes are implicit rather than stated (e.g., due date calculated from invoice date plus net terms).

Manual entry creates two problems: it is slow, and it introduces errors that cause payment delays, duplicate payments, or missed early-payment discounts.

## The AI Approach

Modern document AI combines two capabilities: optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text from any document format, and large language model reasoning to identify and normalize fields regardless of layout variation.

Amazon Textract handles the OCR and structure extraction - it detects tables, form fields, and key-value pairs in documents. A subsequent LLM call (via Bedrock) normalizes the extracted data: resolving field name variations, calculating implied fields, and flagging anomalies like mismatched totals.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Extract with Textract.** Send the invoice PDF to Amazon Textract's `AnalyzeDocument` API with the Forms and Tables features enabled. This returns structured key-value pairs and table data without any AI prompt engineering. For most well-formatted invoices, the critical fields are already extracted here.

**Step 2 - Normalize with an LLM.** Pass the Textract output to Claude or another Bedrock model with a prompt that maps extracted fields to your canonical schema (vendor_name, invoice_number, invoice_date, due_date, line_items, subtotal, tax, total). The LLM handles field name variations and can infer missing fields from context.

**Step 3 - Validate and route.** Run business rules on the normalized output: does the line item total match the invoice total? Is the vendor in your approved vendor list? Flag exceptions for human review and auto-approve the rest into your ERP or accounts payable system.

## Where It Breaks

Handwritten invoices, low-quality scans, and non-standard layouts (e.g., invoices embedded in email body text) reduce extraction accuracy. Multi-page invoices with line items spanning pages require more sophisticated chunking logic.

The LLM normalization step can hallucinate field values if the document is ambiguous - always validate extracted totals arithmetically rather than trusting the model's sum.

## The Production Path

Production-grade invoice automation adds a confidence scoring layer: the system routes low-confidence extractions to a human review queue rather than auto-approving. Over time, you can fine-tune thresholds based on error rates. Most teams reach 85-90% straight-through processing within two months of tuning, with human review handling the remainder.
