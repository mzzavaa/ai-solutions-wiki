Most organizations create content once and use it once. A webinar recording sits on YouTube. A research report lives in a PDF. A conference talk exists only as slides. The same insights could reach different audiences in different formats, but repurposing takes effort nobody has time for.

## The Problem

A single piece of long-form content (webinar, whitepaper, conference talk) contains enough material for 5-10 derivative pieces: blog posts, social threads, email snippets, infographic briefs, and FAQ entries. But manually creating each derivative takes 30-60 minutes, so it rarely happens.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read a source piece and generate multiple derivative formats simultaneously, each adapted for its target platform and audience. One input produces many outputs.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Source processing.** Ingest the source content: transcribe video/audio, extract text from PDFs, or accept raw text. Identify the key messages, supporting data points, and quotable statements.

**Step 2 - Multi-format generation.** Prompt the LLM to generate derivatives: a 500-word blog post, a 5-tweet thread, a one-paragraph email snippet, a bullet-point summary, and a FAQ section. Each uses the same source material but adapts tone and structure for the format.

**Step 3 - Editorial queue.** Present all derivatives for review in a single interface. Track which formats perform best to prioritize future repurposing efforts.

## Where It Breaks

Repurposed content can feel repetitive if the same audience encounters multiple formats. The model may lose nuance when compressing long arguments into short formats. Visual content (infographics, video clips) requires design tools beyond text generation.

## The Production Path

Build a content calendar that staggers derivative publication to avoid audience fatigue. Tag all derivatives with their source piece for attribution tracking. Measure engagement per format to learn which repurposing paths deliver the most value.
