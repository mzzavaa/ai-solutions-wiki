Teams drown in logs. Millions of log lines per hour, most of them routine. The important signals - a new error type appearing, an unusual spike in a specific log pattern, a correlation between errors in two different services - are buried in noise. Traditional log analysis requires writing specific queries for known patterns, but it cannot surface unknown unknowns.

## The AI Approach

An LLM periodically analyzes log samples to identify patterns that deviate from normal behavior. It groups related log entries, identifies new error types, correlates events across services, and summarizes findings in plain language.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Sample and aggregate** - Pull log samples from your logging platform (ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch). Aggregate by log pattern using a template extraction algorithm to reduce volume while preserving variety.
2. **Analyze** - Feed aggregated log patterns with their frequencies to an LLM. Ask it to identify patterns that look unusual, new error types that appeared recently, and correlations between different log patterns.
3. **Alert** - Deliver findings as a daily digest or trigger real-time alerts for high-severity anomalies. Include relevant log examples and suggested investigation steps.

## Where It Breaks

Log volume can overwhelm LLM context windows without proper aggregation. The AI does not know your system's normal behavior without baseline data. False positives are common initially until the system learns what is routine.

## The Production Path

Establish a baseline of normal log patterns over several weeks. Use embeddings to cluster log patterns and detect drift from the baseline. Route anomalies to on-call engineers with context. Track which alerts led to actual issues to tune sensitivity over time.
