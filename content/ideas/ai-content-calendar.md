Content teams spend significant time deciding what to publish and when. This planning process often relies on gut instinct rather than data, leading to content that misses audience interest peaks or duplicates recently covered topics.

## The Problem

Building a content calendar requires balancing multiple factors: audience interest trends, seasonal relevance, competitive coverage, internal product milestones, and historical performance data. Doing this manually means spreadsheets, guesswork, and frequent replanning.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze your historical content performance data (engagement metrics, traffic, conversion) alongside external trend signals to suggest topics, optimal publish dates, and content gaps. It can identify patterns humans miss - like which topic clusters drive the most engagement in specific quarters.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data aggregation.** Pull historical content performance from your CMS and analytics platform. Include title, publish date, topic tags, and key metrics (views, engagement, conversion).

**Step 2 - Pattern analysis.** Feed the dataset to an LLM and ask it to identify high-performing topic patterns, seasonal trends, and content gaps. Include any known upcoming product launches or industry events as context.

**Step 3 - Calendar generation.** Have the model generate a draft calendar for the next month or quarter with suggested topics, target publish dates, and rationale for each recommendation.

## Where It Breaks

Historical performance reflects your past audience, not necessarily future interest. Trend analysis based on limited data can produce overconfident recommendations. The model cannot account for internal politics or resource constraints.

## The Production Path

Use the AI-generated calendar as a starting point for editorial planning meetings rather than a final plan. Track recommendation acceptance rates to calibrate future suggestions. Integrate with trend monitoring APIs for real-time topic relevance scoring.
