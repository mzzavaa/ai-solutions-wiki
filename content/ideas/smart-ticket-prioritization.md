Support ticket prioritization is typically set by the customer (who always selects "urgent") or by simple rules (enterprise customers get priority). Neither approach reflects the actual urgency of the issue described in the ticket.

## The Problem

A customer reporting a complete system outage and a customer asking how to change a password might both be tagged as "high priority." The support team has to read each ticket to assess real urgency, and by the time they get to a genuinely critical ticket buried in the queue, the customer has been waiting too long.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read ticket content, assess the described issue's severity, check the customer's account context (contract tier, recent ticket history, account health), and assign a priority score that reflects actual urgency rather than self-reported urgency.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Ticket enrichment.** When a ticket arrives, pull customer context: account tier, contract terms, recent ticket history, and any open incidents on their account.

**Step 2 - AI prioritization.** Send the ticket content and customer context to an LLM. The model assesses: issue severity (outage vs. question vs. feature request), business impact (based on account size and contract), and urgency signals in the language.

**Step 3 - Queue reordering.** Insert the ticket into the support queue at the AI-determined priority position. Flag tickets where AI priority significantly differs from customer-stated priority for quick human review.

## Where It Breaks

The model may underweight emotional distress that is not expressed in technical terms. Tickets with minimal content are hard to prioritize accurately. Customers who have learned to game priority systems may include urgency keywords that mislead the model.

## The Production Path

Run AI prioritization in parallel with existing prioritization for one month and compare outcomes. Measure time-to-resolution for high-urgency issues under both systems. Tune severity definitions based on your specific product's failure modes.
