Schema migrations are nerve-wracking because they are hard to reverse and can lock tables, break queries, or corrupt data if done wrong. Developers write migration scripts manually and hope they accounted for all the edge cases. A missed foreign key constraint or an unintended table lock during a rename can cause downtime.

## The AI Approach

An LLM analyzes your current schema, the proposed changes, and your database engine's specific migration behavior to generate safe migration scripts, identify risks, and plan rollback strategies.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Describe the change** - Provide the current schema and the desired end state in natural language or DDL. "Add a nullable column `preferred_language` to the users table and backfill it from the profiles table."
2. **Generate migration** - The LLM produces a migration script tailored to your database engine. For PostgreSQL, it knows to use `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` with a default to avoid table rewrites. For MySQL, it considers table locking implications.
3. **Risk assessment** - The LLM identifies potential issues: will this lock the table? Is this backwards-compatible with the current application code? What happens if the migration fails halfway through? It generates a rollback script alongside the forward migration.

## Where It Breaks

The AI does not know your table sizes or production load patterns. A migration that is safe on a small table may lock a billion-row table for minutes. It also cannot predict application-level issues - code that queries a renamed column will break regardless of how safe the migration script is.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your migration framework (Flyway, Alembic, Knex). Generate migration and rollback scripts as a pair. Run the generated migration against a copy of production data to validate timing and correctness before applying to production.
