Pricing changes by competitors can significantly impact your business, but most teams discover them days or weeks after they happen - often from a customer asking for a price match. By then, you have already lost deals.

## The Problem

Monitoring competitor pricing across product lines and regions requires checking websites, marketplaces, and distributor listings regularly. Changes are easy to miss when they are small (2-3% adjustments) or apply only to specific SKUs or regions.

## The AI Approach

Automated web monitoring detects pricing changes on competitor sites. An LLM analyzes the changes in context - assessing whether they represent a strategic shift, a promotional event, or a routine adjustment - and recommends whether a response is warranted.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Price monitoring.** Set up web scrapers or change detection tools on competitor pricing pages and marketplace listings. Store historical prices for comparison.

**Step 2 - Change analysis.** When a price change is detected, send it to an LLM with context: the product category, your current pricing, historical competitor pricing patterns, and current market conditions. The model classifies the change (promotional, strategic, cost-driven) and assesses impact.

**Step 3 - Response recommendation.** For significant changes, generate a recommendation: match, ignore, differentiate, or bundle. Distribute to pricing and sales teams with supporting analysis.

## Where It Breaks

Dynamic pricing and personalized pricing mean the prices you see may not reflect what customers actually pay. Promotional pricing is temporary but can trigger unnecessary responses. Scraping competitor sites may violate terms of service.

## The Production Path

Start with your top five competitors and their most directly competitive products. Establish response protocols for different change categories. Track win/loss rate changes after pricing responses to measure effectiveness.
