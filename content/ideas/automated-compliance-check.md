Compliance checking is tedious, high-stakes, and repetitive - a perfect combination for AI assistance. A compliance analyst reading a 50-page policy document against a 200-item checklist is doing work that a model can accelerate significantly.

## The Problem

Regulatory requirements change frequently, and verifying that internal documents, processes, and controls comply with current requirements is labor-intensive. Missing a single requirement can result in fines, audit findings, or operational restrictions. Manual reviews are thorough but slow and expensive.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read a document and check it against a structured list of compliance requirements, identifying which requirements are addressed, which are missing, and which are partially addressed. The model provides specific citations from the document for each finding.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Requirement structuring.** Convert your regulatory requirements or compliance checklist into a structured format with clear, testable criteria for each item.

**Step 2 - Document analysis.** Send the document and requirements list to an LLM. For each requirement, the model returns: status (met, not met, partially met), the relevant section of the document, and an explanation of any gaps.

**Step 3 - Gap report.** Generate a compliance gap report listing all unmet or partially met requirements with recommended remediation actions. Route to the compliance team for review and action.

## Where It Breaks

The model may mark a requirement as met based on surface-level keyword matching when the actual implementation is insufficient. Complex regulatory interpretations require legal judgment. The model cannot verify that described controls are actually implemented in practice.

## The Production Path

Position the AI as a first-pass screening tool that reduces human reviewer workload by 60-70%, not as a replacement for human judgment. Build requirement-specific test cases to validate the model's accuracy on your regulatory framework before relying on it.
