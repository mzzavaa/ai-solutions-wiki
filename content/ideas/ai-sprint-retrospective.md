Sprint retrospectives often recycle the same themes because teams lack visibility into patterns across multiple sprints. "We over-committed again" is hard to act on when nobody tracks how much over-commitment happened or which types of stories are consistently underestimated.

## The AI Approach

An LLM analyzes sprint data - velocity trends, story completion rates, commit patterns, and team survey responses - to identify recurring themes, quantify patterns, and suggest specific improvements grounded in data rather than gut feeling.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Gather sprint data** - Pull story completion rates, velocity, carry-over items, bug counts, and cycle time from your project tracker (Jira, Linear). Collect team sentiment via a quick pre-retro survey.
2. **Pattern analysis** - Feed multiple sprints of data to an LLM. Ask it to identify trends (declining velocity, increasing carry-over), recurring themes from surveys, and correlations (e.g., sprints with high bug counts follow sprints with high story points committed).
3. **Generate insights** - Produce a retrospective briefing with data-backed observations and specific, actionable improvement suggestions. Present it at the start of the retro to ground the conversation in facts.

## Where It Breaks

Quantitative metrics miss qualitative context. A sprint with low velocity might have been intentional (tech debt week). The AI cannot capture interpersonal dynamics or morale issues that affect team performance. It supplements, not replaces, the human conversation.

## The Production Path

Run automatically at the end of each sprint. Track which suggested improvements the team adopted and whether metrics improved afterward. Over time, build a history of what interventions actually work for your specific team.
