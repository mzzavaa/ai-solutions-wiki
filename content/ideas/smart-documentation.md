Documentation goes stale the moment code changes. An API endpoint gets a new parameter, but the docs still show the old signature. A configuration option is removed, but the setup guide still references it. Teams know this is a problem but rarely have the discipline to update docs with every code change.

## The AI Approach

An AI system monitors pull requests for code changes that affect documented behavior. When it detects a mismatch between the code change and existing documentation, it either generates an updated doc or flags the inconsistency for a human to address.

## Three-Step Build

1. **Map code to docs** - Create a mapping between code files and their corresponding documentation. API route handlers map to API docs. Configuration schemas map to setup guides.
2. **Change detection** - On each PR, identify which documentation-relevant code files changed. Extract the nature of the change using an LLM.
3. **Doc update or alert** - If the change is straightforward (new parameter, changed default value), generate an updated doc and include it as a suggestion in the PR. If the change is complex, post a comment flagging which docs need human attention.

## Where It Breaks

The code-to-docs mapping requires initial manual setup and maintenance. Not all code changes affect documentation. The AI may generate false positives, flagging documentation that is actually still correct, leading to alert fatigue.

## The Production Path

Integrate as a CI check or a GitHub Action that runs on every PR. Start with detection-only mode that posts comments rather than generating doc updates. Gradually enable auto-generated updates for well-understood, repetitive doc patterns like API reference pages. Keep complex conceptual documentation in the human-review lane.
