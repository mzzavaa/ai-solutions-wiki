Standard business reports show you what happened. Trend detection shows you what is about to happen. The difference between reacting to a trend and anticipating it can be worth millions in revenue or cost savings.

## The Problem

Business dashboards show current metrics and historical comparisons, but they require a human to notice subtle pattern shifts. A gradual 1% weekly decline in a metric is invisible on a dashboard but compounds to a 40% annual decline. By the time someone notices, the trend has been running for months.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can analyze time-series business data and identify emerging trends, pattern breaks, and anomalies that are too subtle for dashboard monitoring. It translates statistical patterns into business-language insights that non-analysts can act on.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Data pipeline.** Set up automated extraction of key business metrics: revenue by segment, customer acquisition and churn rates, product usage metrics, support volume, and operational efficiency indicators.

**Step 2 - Trend analysis.** Feed historical data (3-12 months) to an LLM weekly. Ask it to identify: new trends emerging in the last 4 weeks, accelerating or decelerating existing trends, anomalies that deviate from seasonal patterns, and leading indicators that precede known outcomes.

**Step 3 - Insight distribution.** Generate a weekly "emerging trends" brief for leadership with each trend described in business terms, its potential impact if it continues, and a recommended investigation or response.

## Where It Breaks

Statistical trend detection requires more rigor than an LLM provides - false positives are common with noisy data. Short time windows produce unreliable trend signals. The model may identify noise as signal, especially in volatile metrics.

## The Production Path

Pair LLM-based trend narratives with proper statistical methods (moving averages, change point detection) for validation. Track which identified trends proved meaningful to calibrate sensitivity. Focus on metrics with clear business impact to keep the signal-to-noise ratio high.
