Corporate travel booking is a multi-constraint optimization problem that people solve poorly. Travelers pick the most convenient option regardless of cost; travel managers enforce policy after the fact; and the company overspends because optimization happens too late in the process.

## The Problem

Travel policies are complex documents that most employees never read. Preferred airlines, hotel rate caps, advance booking requirements, and approval thresholds create a decision space too complicated for a traveler to navigate efficiently while also doing their actual job.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can ingest your travel policy, the traveler's preferences, the trip requirements, and available options to recommend optimal itineraries that balance cost, convenience, and policy compliance. It acts as a travel-policy-aware assistant.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Policy ingestion.** Feed your travel policy document to the system as persistent context. Include rate caps, preferred vendors, advance booking requirements, and approval thresholds by role and destination.

**Step 2 - Trip optimization.** When a travel request comes in, query flight and hotel APIs for available options. Pass options to the LLM with the traveler's preferences and policy constraints. The model ranks options by overall fit and flags any that require exception approval.

**Step 3 - Booking and approval.** Present the top three recommended itineraries to the traveler. Auto-route within-policy bookings for immediate confirmation; flag out-of-policy selections for manager approval with an explanation of the cost difference.

## Where It Breaks

Real-time pricing means recommendations become stale quickly. Complex multi-city itineraries with connection constraints are hard to optimize. Personal preferences (window seat, specific hotel chain loyalty) add subjective factors the model weighs imperfectly.

## The Production Path

Integrate with your corporate travel management platform's API. Track savings achieved by AI-recommended options versus traveler's initial selection. Use historical booking data to improve preference learning for frequent travelers.
