High-volume email inboxes - customer support queues, procurement inboxes, HR inquiry mailboxes - spend significant human time doing triage: reading each email, deciding what type it is, and forwarding it to the right person or team. AI classification handles this triage layer reliably and at scale.

## The Problem

Manual email triage creates bottlenecks and inconsistency. The same inquiry type may be routed differently depending on who is doing triage that day. Urgent requests sit in a queue with routine ones. Emails requiring multiple teams get forwarded once and the secondary team is forgotten.

The result is slower response times, routing errors that require re-work, and triage staff spending their time on classification rather than resolution.

## The AI Approach

LLMs excel at text classification tasks, especially when categories are well-defined and the classification criteria can be expressed in natural language. Unlike traditional rule-based routing (keyword matching), LLM classification understands intent: an email that says "I need to cancel everything" is understood as a cancellation request even though it contains no category-specific keywords.

Classification is combined with extraction: the model identifies the category, urgency level, sender's apparent intent, and any key entities (account number, product name, deadline mentioned) in a single pass.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Define your taxonomy.** List the 5-15 categories your inbox receives. For each, write 2-3 example subjects and first sentences. This becomes the classification prompt. Clear category definitions with examples are more important than model choice for getting classification right.

**Step 2 - Classify with a Bedrock call.** Send the email subject and first 200 words to a fast, low-cost model (Claude Haiku or similar) with a structured classification prompt. Request a JSON response with: category, urgency (high/medium/low), extracted entities, and a one-sentence summary. The 200-word limit keeps latency and cost low; the full body is rarely needed for classification.

**Step 3 - Route based on output.** Use the classification JSON to trigger your routing logic: assign to a queue, create a ticket in your support system, send a Slack alert for high-urgency items, or auto-reply with an acknowledgment. Use AWS Step Functions or a simple Lambda to orchestrate the routing rules.

## Where It Breaks

Ambiguous emails that could fit multiple categories are a persistent challenge. The model will pick the most likely category, but for borderline cases you want a confidence signal and a fallback to human review. Some LLMs do not natively produce well-calibrated confidence scores - use a separate verification prompt if confidence matters.

## The Production Path

Start by running the classifier in shadow mode alongside your existing process: classify emails but route them manually, then compare the AI classification to what the human would have done. Measure agreement rate. Once you reach 90%+ agreement on clear cases, enable automatic routing for those categories and keep the ambiguous cases in a human review queue.
