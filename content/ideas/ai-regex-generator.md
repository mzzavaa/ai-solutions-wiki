Regular expressions are powerful and notoriously hard to write correctly. Developers spend time on regex debugging sites, testing edge cases, and deciphering expressions written by others. Most regex tasks start with a plain English description of the desired pattern: "match email addresses" or "extract the version number from this string format."

## The AI Approach

An LLM translates natural language pattern descriptions into regular expressions. Because the model understands both natural language and regex syntax, it can handle nuanced requests like "match phone numbers in US or international format, with or without country code."

## Three-Step Build

1. **Input** - Accept a natural language description of the pattern and optionally a few example strings that should match and strings that should not match.
2. **Generate** - Send the description and examples to an LLM with a prompt that produces the regex, an explanation of each component, and test cases.
3. **Validate** - Run the generated regex against the provided examples and the AI-generated test cases. Report any mismatches and iterate.

## Where It Breaks

Complex patterns with lookaheads, lookbehinds, and backreferences may not match the user's intent on the first try. Regex flavors differ between languages (Python, JavaScript, PCRE), and the model may generate syntax not supported by the user's target language.

## The Production Path

Build as a CLI tool or IDE extension that accepts a description and target language, generates the regex, validates it against examples, and inserts it into code with a comment explaining the pattern. Include a feedback loop so users can refine the regex by describing what went wrong.
