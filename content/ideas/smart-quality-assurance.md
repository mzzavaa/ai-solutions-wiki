QA teams write test cases by reading requirements and imagining what could go wrong. This process depends heavily on the tester's experience, and even experienced testers miss edge cases because human imagination is bounded by familiarity.

## The Problem

Test case creation is time-consuming and inconsistent. Junior testers write shallow tests. Senior testers write thorough tests but their time is expensive. Requirements documents often describe the happy path clearly but leave error handling and edge cases implicit. The result is test coverage that looks comprehensive on paper but misses real failure modes.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read a requirements document and systematically generate test cases covering normal flows, boundary conditions, error paths, and edge cases. The model's breadth of training means it can suggest failure scenarios that even experienced testers might not consider.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Requirements input.** Feed the feature requirements, user stories, or specification document to the system. Include any API contracts, data schemas, or business rules that define expected behavior.

**Step 2 - Test case generation.** Prompt the LLM to generate test cases in categories: happy path, boundary values, invalid inputs, error handling, concurrency scenarios, and security edge cases. Request structured output with preconditions, steps, and expected results.

**Step 3 - Review and integrate.** Present generated test cases to the QA team for review. Remove duplicates and irrelevant cases, then import approved cases into your test management tool.

## Where It Breaks

Generated test cases may be technically valid but impractical to execute. The model cannot know your system's actual implementation constraints. Performance and load testing scenarios require infrastructure context beyond what requirements provide.

## The Production Path

Use AI-generated test cases as a supplement to human-written ones, not a replacement. Track which AI-generated cases find real bugs to measure effectiveness. Feed bug reports back to improve future test generation prompts.
