Creating training content is a bottleneck for L&D teams. Subject matter experts have the knowledge but not the time to create courses. Training designers have the skills but depend on experts who are too busy to contribute. The result is training content that is always behind current practices.

## The Problem

Process documentation and knowledge base articles contain the raw material for training, but transforming reference material into effective learning content (with objectives, exercises, assessments, and progressive complexity) requires instructional design effort that most teams cannot afford for every topic.

## The AI Approach

An LLM can read existing documentation and generate structured training content: learning objectives, explanatory text, worked examples, practice exercises, and assessment questions. The output follows instructional design principles while requiring only editorial review rather than creation from scratch.

## Three-Step Build

**Step 1 - Source material.** Identify the documentation, process guides, and knowledge base articles that cover the training topic. Compile them as input along with the target audience description and skill level.

**Step 2 - Content generation.** Prompt the LLM to create a training module with: learning objectives, concept explanations with examples, step-by-step exercises, common mistakes to avoid, and a 10-question quiz with answer key.

**Step 3 - Review and publish.** Have a subject matter expert review for accuracy and a training designer review for pedagogical quality. Publish to your LMS or training platform.

## Where It Breaks

AI-generated examples may be technically correct but unrealistic for your specific environment. Quiz questions may test recall rather than understanding without careful prompt design. Hands-on exercises that require system access need environment setup that the model cannot create.

## The Production Path

Build templates for different content types (process training, software training, compliance training) to ensure consistent quality. Track quiz pass rates and learner feedback to identify content that needs human improvement. Update training content automatically when source documentation changes.
