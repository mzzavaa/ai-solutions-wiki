Model governance is the set of policies, processes, and tools that ensure AI models in production are reliable, compliant, and accountable. Without governance, organizations accumulate "shadow models" - models running in production that no one understands, no one owns, and no one monitors. Model governance prevents this by establishing clear rules for how models are developed, approved, deployed, monitored, and retired.

## Why Model Governance Matters

**Regulatory compliance.** The EU AI Act, US federal guidelines, and industry-specific regulations (healthcare, finance) increasingly require documentation, testing, and oversight of AI systems. Governance provides the framework for compliance.

**Risk management.** A model making wrong predictions can cause financial loss, reputational damage, or harm to people. Governance ensures that models are tested and monitored before and after deployment.

**Operational reliability.** Without governance, model deployments are ad hoc, rollbacks are difficult, and debugging is impossible because there is no record of what is running or why.

**Institutional knowledge.** When model developers leave the organization, governance documentation ensures the team can understand, maintain, and update models.

## Core Components

### Model Registry

A model registry is a centralized catalog of all models, their versions, and their metadata:

**What to store:**
- Model artifact (serialized model file)
- Model version and lineage (which code, data, and hyperparameters produced it)
- Training data reference (version or hash of the training dataset)
- Evaluation results (metrics on test datasets)
- Model card (description, intended use, limitations, fairness assessment)
- Deployment status (development, staging, production, retired)
- Owner (team or individual responsible)

**Tools:** SageMaker Model Registry, MLflow Model Registry, or custom solutions built on S3 and DynamoDB.

**Rule:** No model reaches production without being registered. This is non-negotiable.

### Approval Workflow

Define who must approve a model before it can be deployed:

**Approval stages:**
1. **Technical review.** ML engineer reviews model quality, code quality, and test coverage. Verifies that evaluation results meet minimum thresholds.
2. **Business review.** Product manager or business stakeholder confirms that the model meets business requirements and that the use case is approved.
3. **Compliance review.** For regulated use cases, legal or compliance team reviews the model card, bias assessment, and data usage for regulatory compliance.
4. **Deployment approval.** Operations or release manager approves the deployment plan, including monitoring setup and rollback procedures.

Not every model needs all four stages. Define risk tiers:
- **Low risk** (internal tool, no customer impact): technical review only
- **Medium risk** (customer-facing, non-critical): technical + business review
- **High risk** (financial, healthcare, hiring decisions): all four stages

### Audit Trail

Maintain a complete record of every action taken on a model:

**What to log:**
- Model creation, training, and evaluation events
- Approval decisions (who approved, when, with what conditions)
- Deployment events (when deployed, to which environment, by whom)
- Configuration changes (parameter changes, threshold adjustments)
- Incidents (errors, performance degradation, rollbacks)
- Retirement events (when retired, why, replacement model)

**Storage:** Immutable log storage (S3 with object lock, write-once database). Audit trails should be tamper-proof.

### Model Cards

A model card is standardized documentation for a model:

**Required sections:**
- **Model overview:** What does the model do? What task does it perform?
- **Intended use:** What is the model designed for? What should it NOT be used for?
- **Training data:** What data was used? What is the data source? What time period does it cover?
- **Evaluation:** What metrics were computed? On what test data? What are the results?
- **Fairness analysis:** Performance across demographic groups. Known disparities.
- **Limitations:** Known failure modes, edge cases, and scenarios where the model performs poorly.
- **Operational requirements:** Compute requirements, latency expectations, monitoring needs.

Model cards should be created during development and updated throughout the model's lifecycle.

## Lifecycle Management

### Development Stage

**Requirements.** Data scientists work in isolated environments with version-controlled code and tracked experiments. All experiments are logged.

**Policies:** No production data in development environments without appropriate access controls. Experiments are reproducible (code, data, and configuration are versioned).

### Staging Stage

**Requirements.** Models are deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production. Integration tests verify end-to-end behavior.

**Policies:** Staging deployment requires technical review approval. Performance must meet minimum thresholds on staging test data.

### Production Stage

**Requirements.** Models serve live traffic with full monitoring, alerting, and rollback capability.

**Policies:** Production deployment requires all applicable approvals. Monitoring dashboards and alerts are configured before deployment. Rollback procedures are documented and tested.

### Monitoring Stage

**Requirements.** Continuous monitoring of model quality, data drift, and operational health.

**Policies:** Define quality thresholds that trigger alerts. Define drift thresholds that trigger retraining. Review model performance at defined intervals (monthly, quarterly).

### Retirement Stage

**Requirements.** Models that are no longer needed or have been replaced are formally retired.

**Policies:** Retirement requires documentation of the reason, the replacement model (if any), and confirmation that no active systems depend on the retired model. Archive model artifacts and audit trails per retention policy.

## Implementation Approach

**Start simple.** Begin with a model registry and basic approval workflow. Do not try to implement full governance overnight.

**Automate progressively.** Manual approvals for the first few models, then automate checks that can be automated (test coverage, performance thresholds) and keep human review for subjective assessments.

**Integrate with existing tools.** Use existing CI/CD pipelines for deployment automation. Use existing ticketing systems for approval workflows. Do not build parallel systems.

**Enforce through tooling.** Governance policies that depend on people remembering to follow them fail. Build the policies into the tools: the deployment pipeline requires a registered model, the registry requires a model card, the model card requires evaluation results.

Model governance is not bureaucracy - it is the infrastructure that enables organizations to deploy AI confidently and at scale. The investment in governance pays for itself the first time it prevents a bad model from reaching production or enables a quick rollback when something goes wrong.
