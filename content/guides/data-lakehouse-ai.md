A data lakehouse combines the flexibility and cost-efficiency of a data lake with the data management features of a data warehouse: ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel, and fine-grained access control. For AI/ML workloads, the lakehouse provides a unified platform where data engineering, analytics, and model training operate on the same data without copying it between systems.

## Why Lakehouse for AI

Traditional architectures force a choice. Data lakes store raw data cheaply but lack the data quality guarantees ML needs. Data warehouses provide quality and governance but are expensive and poorly suited to the unstructured data and large-scale reads that ML training requires. The lakehouse resolves this by adding warehouse-quality management to lake-scale storage.

ML workloads specifically benefit from time travel (reproducing the exact dataset used for a historical training run), schema enforcement (catching data quality issues before they corrupt training data), ACID transactions (ensuring training data reads are consistent even while ETL jobs are writing), and open formats (reading data directly from training frameworks without export).

## Architecture Layers

**Storage layer** - Object storage (S3, ADLS, GCS) as the foundation. All data lives in open file formats: Parquet for structured data, with Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, or Apache Hudi providing the transaction and metadata layer on top.

**Table format layer** - Delta Lake or Apache Iceberg add ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel, and partition management to files in object storage. Choose one table format and standardize. Iceberg has broader engine compatibility. Delta Lake has tighter Databricks integration.

**Processing layer** - Apache Spark, Trino, Dask, or Ray for data transformation and feature engineering. The same engine can serve both analytics queries and ML data preparation, reducing data movement.

**ML integration layer** - Feature stores (Feast, Tecton, SageMaker Feature Store) read from lakehouse tables and serve features for both training and inference. Experiment tracking systems (MLflow) log training runs with references to specific lakehouse table versions.

## Medallion Architecture

Organize data in Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. Bronze contains raw ingested data with minimal transformation. Silver contains cleaned, deduplicated, and validated data. Gold contains feature-engineered datasets optimized for specific use cases.

ML training typically reads from Silver (for custom feature engineering) or Gold (for pre-computed features). The clear layering ensures that data quality issues are caught and fixed at the Silver layer before they propagate to training datasets.

## Data Quality for ML

Data quality failures in a lakehouse silently degrade model performance. Implement automated data quality checks at each layer transition. Validate schema conformance, null rates, value distributions, referential integrity, and freshness. Block data promotion from Bronze to Silver or Silver to Gold when quality checks fail.

Track data quality metrics over time. A gradual increase in null rates or a shift in value distributions is an early warning of data drift that will eventually affect model performance.

## Versioning and Reproducibility

Use the table format's time travel capability to snapshot the exact data used for each training run. Record the table version or timestamp alongside each experiment in your experiment tracking system. This enables exact reproduction of any training run and supports audit requirements for data traceability.

For datasets that evolve through feature engineering code changes, version the code alongside the data. A training run is reproducible only when both the data version and the code version are recorded.

## Access Control

Implement fine-grained access control at the table and column level. ML teams should have read access to the data they need for training and nothing more. PII columns should be masked or excluded for teams that do not have a justified need to access them. Use the lakehouse's built-in access control mechanisms or overlay a governance layer like Unity Catalog or AWS Lake Formation.

## Cost Management

Lakehouse storage is cheap; compute is expensive. Optimize by partitioning tables on columns commonly used for filtering in ML queries (date, region, category). Use file compaction to prevent small-file problems that degrade read performance. Set up lifecycle policies to move cold data to cheaper storage tiers. Monitor per-team and per-workload compute costs to identify optimization opportunities.
