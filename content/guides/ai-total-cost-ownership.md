AI projects consistently exceed their budgets because teams underestimate costs beyond model training. Training compute is visible and dramatic, but data preparation, ongoing inference, monitoring, retraining, and personnel costs often dwarf the initial training investment. This guide provides a framework for estimating the full lifecycle cost of an AI platform.

## Cost Categories

### Data Costs

**Data acquisition.** Purchasing third-party datasets, licensing fees, or API costs for data providers. Some datasets carry per-record or per-query costs that scale with usage.

**Data labeling.** Human annotation is often the largest single cost in supervised learning projects. Costs range from $0.01 per label (simple binary classification) to $50+ per label (expert medical annotation). A project needing 100,000 labeled examples at $1 each costs $100,000 in labeling alone.

**Data storage.** Raw data, processed data, feature stores, and training artifacts all consume storage. Cloud storage costs are low per GB but accumulate across terabytes of training data retained over years.

**Data pipeline infrastructure.** ETL/ELT tools, streaming platforms, data quality tools, and orchestration services. These carry both compute costs and licensing fees.

### Compute Costs

**Training compute.** GPU/TPU hours for model training. A single training run for a large model can cost $10,000-$1,000,000+. Factor in failed experiments and hyperparameter sweeps, which multiply training costs by 5-20x.

**Inference compute.** The ongoing cost of serving predictions. For high-traffic services, inference costs exceed training costs within months. A model serving 10 million predictions per day at $0.001 each costs $10,000 per day, or $3.65 million per year.

**Development compute.** Jupyter notebooks, development environments, CI/CD pipelines, and staging environments. Often underestimated, these typically add 20-30% to the production compute budget.

**Experimentation compute.** A/B tests, shadow deployments, and canary releases require running multiple model versions simultaneously, multiplying serving costs during testing periods.

### Personnel Costs

**Data scientists** for model development and experimentation. Fully loaded cost (salary, benefits, overhead): $200,000-$400,000 per year per engineer, depending on market and seniority.

**ML engineers** for productionizing models, building serving infrastructure, and maintaining pipelines. Similar compensation range.

**Data engineers** for data pipeline development and maintenance. Typically 1-2 data engineers per data scientist to keep pipelines running reliably.

**DevOps/MLOps engineers** for infrastructure, monitoring, and automation. At least one per AI product team.

**Domain experts** for requirements, labeling oversight, and validation. Often fractional but essential.

### Operational Costs

**Monitoring and observability.** Logging, metrics collection, alerting, and dashboard tools. Cloud monitoring costs scale with the volume of metrics and logs ingested.

**Retraining.** Models require periodic retraining as data drifts. Budget for monthly or quarterly retraining cycles, including validation and deployment costs.

**Incident response.** Model failures, data pipeline outages, and performance degradation require on-call support. The cost of incidents includes both the personnel time and the business impact of degraded service.

**Compliance and auditing.** Regulatory requirements may mandate model explainability reports, bias audits, and data lineage documentation. These require both tooling and personnel time.

## Building a TCO Model

Structure the TCO model across three phases:

**Phase 1: Development (6-12 months).** Data acquisition and labeling, initial training experiments, infrastructure setup, and team ramp-up. This is the highest uncertainty phase. Budget a 50% contingency.

**Phase 2: Launch (1-3 months).** Final training runs, A/B testing, production infrastructure provisioning, monitoring setup, and documentation. Costs are more predictable but often underestimated.

**Phase 3: Operations (ongoing).** Inference compute, retraining, monitoring, maintenance, and team costs. This phase represents the majority of lifetime costs. A 3-year operational cost projection often exceeds development costs by 3-5x.

## Hidden Costs

**Opportunity cost of failed experiments.** Not every AI project succeeds. Budget for the possibility that 30-50% of AI initiatives will not reach production. The cost of failed experiments is real and should be allocated across successful projects.

**Technical debt.** Quick-fix solutions during development (hardcoded thresholds, manual data pipelines, missing monitoring) create ongoing maintenance costs. Budget time for technical debt reduction in every quarter.

**Vendor lock-in.** Using managed ML services (SageMaker, Vertex AI) reduces initial development costs but creates switching costs. Include migration estimates in the TCO if vendor diversification is a strategic goal.

**Knowledge concentration risk.** If one data scientist understands the model and they leave, the cost of rebuilding institutional knowledge is substantial. Documentation and knowledge sharing are investments that reduce this risk.

## TCO Optimization

Reduce TCO without compromising quality: use spot/preemptible instances for training (50-70% savings), implement model caching for repeated predictions, right-size GPU instances based on actual utilization, automate retraining pipelines to reduce manual effort, and use model distillation to reduce inference costs for production serving.
