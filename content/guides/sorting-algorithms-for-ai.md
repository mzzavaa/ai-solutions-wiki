Every AI pipeline that produces more than one result needs to rank them. Ranking is sorting. Understanding the algorithms behind sorting and search - their complexity, tradeoffs, and practical behavior - is foundational to building AI systems that perform well at scale.

## Sorting Algorithms

**Quicksort** is the most widely used general-purpose sort. It works by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array into elements smaller and larger than the pivot, and recursively sorting each partition. Average time complexity: O(n log n). Worst case: O(n^2) on already-sorted data with naive pivot selection. Python's built-in `sorted()` uses Timsort, a hybrid of merge sort and insertion sort optimized for real-world data patterns.

**Mergesort** divides the array in half repeatedly, sorts each half, then merges them. Always O(n log n) - no worst case degradation. It is stable (preserves the original order of equal elements) and is preferred when stability matters. Mergesort requires O(n) extra memory for the merge step.

**Heapsort** builds a heap data structure (a complete binary tree where each parent is larger than its children), then repeatedly extracts the maximum. Always O(n log n), in-place (no extra memory), but not stable and has poor cache performance in practice.

For AI applications, the choice between these matters less than understanding the O(n log n) baseline. When sorting a list of 10,000 video clips by composite score, any of these algorithms completes in roughly 130,000 operations. An O(n^2) algorithm would take 100 million.

## Search Algorithms

**Binary search** requires a sorted array and works by repeatedly halving the search space: compare the target to the middle element, eliminate half the array, repeat. Time complexity: O(log n). Finding a specific clip ID in a sorted list of 10,000 clips takes at most 14 comparisons. Linear search (scanning from the start) takes up to 10,000.

**Hash tables** achieve O(1) average lookup by mapping keys to array positions via a hash function. A dictionary in Python is a hash table. Hash tables are the right structure when you need fast lookup by a specific key (clip ID, face ID, document hash) rather than by rank.

**Tree search** traverses a tree structure. Binary search trees give O(log n) average-case lookup and insertion. In AI applications, vector databases use approximate nearest-neighbor tree structures (HNSW, KD-trees) to find the closest embeddings to a query vector without scanning all vectors - this is why vector search is fast despite operating over millions of high-dimensional points.

## Real-World Application: Linda Mohamed's Video Pipeline

Linda Mohamed's AI video pipeline analyzes hours of footage to find the best 3-5 second clips for compilations. The core challenge is algorithmic: given thousands of candidate clips, identify the most engaging ones efficiently.

The pipeline uses a multi-signal scoring system:

- **Emotion scores** from AWS Rekognition (facial expression analysis)
- **Face recognition confidence** (how certain Rekognition is that a face is present and identifiable)
- **Scene labels** (Rekognition's classification of what is happening in the frame)
- **Activity detection** (motion and action signals)

Each signal contributes to a composite score. After all candidates are scored, the pipeline **sorts all clips by composite score** to select the top results. This is straightforward sorting applied to an AI output.

The scoring framework is inspired by WSJF (Weighted Shortest Job First), the prioritization method from SAFe. Each signal is weighted by its reliability and relevance, and the composite is a weighted sum. Sorting by this composite is equivalent to sorting by a business-value-adjusted priority score.

## Search Optimization Through Tiered Analysis

The pipeline does not apply all signals to every frame. Applying expensive Bedrock reasoning to every second of a three-hour video would be cost-prohibitive and slow.

Instead, the pipeline applies a tiered approach:

1. **Tier 1 (cheap)**: Rekognition label detection on every frame identifies scenes with people and activity. Frames without people are immediately excluded.

2. **Threshold gate**: Only clips scoring above a baseline threshold on Tier 1 signals proceed to deeper analysis. This is a search optimization - the pipeline is not scanning all frames at maximum depth; it is pruning the search space early.

3. **Tier 2 (medium cost)**: Emotion and face detection on the surviving candidate set.

4. **Tier 3 (expensive)**: Bedrock content scoring and chaptering decisions only on high-scoring clips from Tier 2.

The threshold gate is binary search applied to a pipeline: rather than processing the full search space exhaustively, you eliminate unpromising candidates early. This reduces expensive Bedrock API calls by 80-90% compared to analyzing every frame.

## Sorting in RAG Systems

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems retrieve candidate documents using vector similarity search, then must decide which documents to pass to the model. The retrieval system returns documents sorted by cosine similarity to the query embedding. Most RAG implementations take the top-k results - the first k elements of a sorted list. This is sorting and selection applied to AI context management.

If the retrieved documents are then re-ranked (e.g., using a cross-encoder model that scores query-document relevance), that is a second sort pass on a smaller set. The two-stage retrieve-then-rerank pattern is algorithmically identical to the tiered analysis pattern above.

## Practical Notes

When implementing scoring and ranking in Python:

```python
# Sort clips by composite score, descending
top_clips = sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: c.composite_score, reverse=True)[:5]

# Or with numpy for large arrays
import numpy as np
scores = np.array([c.composite_score for c in candidates])
top_indices = np.argpartition(scores, -5)[-5:]  # O(n) partial sort for top-k
```

`np.argpartition` is more efficient than full sort when you only need the top-k elements - it is O(n) rather than O(n log n), which matters when processing thousands of clips.
