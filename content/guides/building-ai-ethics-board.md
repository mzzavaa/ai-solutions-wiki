An AI ethics board is an organizational body responsible for reviewing AI use cases, evaluating ethical risks, setting policy, and providing guidance on responsible AI development and deployment. This guide covers how to establish an effective ethics board that makes real decisions rather than serving as a rubber stamp.

## Why You Need One

As AI systems are deployed in more consequential decisions -- hiring, lending, healthcare, criminal justice -- the ethical implications grow. Individual development teams may not have the breadth of perspective needed to identify all potential harms. An ethics board provides a structured mechanism for surfacing concerns, debating tradeoffs, and establishing organization-wide standards before AI systems reach production.

Regulatory pressure is also a factor. The EU AI Act requires conformity assessments for high-risk AI systems. Having an established ethics review process demonstrates organizational commitment to responsible AI and provides a governance structure for meeting regulatory obligations.

## Board Composition

An effective ethics board includes diverse perspectives. Over-representation of any single viewpoint creates blind spots.

**Technical members** - ML engineers and data scientists who understand how the systems work, their capabilities, and their failure modes. They translate technical details for non-technical members and assess technical feasibility of proposed safeguards.

**Legal and compliance** - Attorneys with expertise in data protection, anti-discrimination, and sector-specific regulations. They identify legal risks and regulatory requirements that constrain AI system design.

**Domain experts** - People with deep knowledge of the domains where AI systems will be deployed. A healthcare ethics board needs clinicians. A financial services board needs risk management professionals.

**External perspectives** - Representatives from affected communities, academic ethicists, or independent advisors who are not employed by the organization. External members reduce groupthink and bring perspectives the organization may lack internally.

**Business leadership** - Senior leaders with authority to enforce board decisions. Without executive support, ethics board recommendations become optional suggestions that are ignored under business pressure.

## Charter and Scope

Define the board's authority clearly. Specifically document which AI use cases require board review (typically based on risk classification), whether board decisions are advisory or binding, what the review process and timeline look like, how appeals and exceptions are handled, and how the board's decisions are documented and tracked.

A common failure mode is establishing a board with no authority. If the board can only recommend and development teams can proceed without board approval, the board will be bypassed whenever its recommendations are inconvenient.

## Review Process

Establish a standard review workflow. Teams submit an AI use case proposal that describes the system's purpose, the data it uses, the decisions it makes or influences, the affected stakeholders, and the proposed safeguards. The board evaluates the proposal against the organization's responsible AI principles, identifies additional risks, and issues a decision: approved, approved with conditions, or rejected with specific concerns that must be addressed.

Set review timelines that are fast enough not to block development but thorough enough to be meaningful. A two-week review cycle is common. Expedited reviews should be available for low-risk use cases.

## Maintaining Effectiveness

Schedule regular board meetings regardless of whether reviews are pending. Use standing meetings to review monitoring data from deployed AI systems, discuss emerging ethical challenges in the field, update policies based on new regulatory developments, and conduct retrospectives on previous board decisions.

Track the outcomes of board decisions. Did the conditions imposed on approved use cases get implemented? Did rejected use cases get resubmitted with adequate changes? Are deployed systems performing within the ethical bounds the board defined? An ethics board that makes decisions but never follows up is not providing effective governance.

Publish an annual transparency report summarizing the number of reviews conducted, decisions made, and any incidents involving AI ethics concerns. Transparency builds organizational trust in the board's role.
