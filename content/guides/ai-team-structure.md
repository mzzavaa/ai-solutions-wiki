The way you structure your AI team determines what you can build, how fast you can build it, and whether it survives first contact with the rest of the organization. There is no single correct structure - it depends on your organization's size, AI maturity, and how central AI is to your business strategy.

## Common Organizational Models

### Centralized AI Team

A single AI team serves the entire organization, taking requests from business units and delivering AI solutions.

**Advantages.** Consistent standards and practices. Efficient use of scarce AI talent. Knowledge sharing across projects. Easier to maintain shared infrastructure (MLOps platforms, feature stores, model registries).

**Disadvantages.** Becomes a bottleneck as demand grows. Lacks deep domain expertise in any single business area. Prioritization across competing business units creates political friction. The team is always context-switching between domains.

**Best for:** Organizations early in their AI journey with fewer than 10 AI practitioners.

### Embedded AI Engineers

AI practitioners sit within business unit teams, working alongside domain experts, product managers, and software engineers.

**Advantages.** Deep domain expertise. Fast feedback loops with stakeholders. AI work is directly aligned with business unit priorities. Less coordination overhead.

**Disadvantages.** Inconsistent practices across teams. Duplication of infrastructure work. Isolated practitioners miss knowledge sharing. Harder to recruit when the team is one or two people within a larger non-AI team.

**Best for:** Organizations where AI is deeply integrated into specific products and domain expertise matters more than technical standardization.

### Hub and Spoke (Recommended for Most)

A central AI platform team provides shared infrastructure, standards, and specialized expertise. Embedded AI engineers in business units build solutions using the platform and consult with the hub on complex problems.

**Advantages.** Combines the benefits of both models. Shared infrastructure reduces duplication. Embedded engineers get domain depth. The hub provides career growth, knowledge sharing, and standards.

**Disadvantages.** Requires clear ownership boundaries between hub and spokes. The platform team must treat business unit engineers as customers, not subordinates. Governance overhead.

**Best for:** Organizations with 10+ AI practitioners and multiple business units using AI.

## Core Roles

### Data Engineer

Builds and maintains data pipelines, data warehouses, and feature stores. Ensures data is available, clean, and accessible for model development. This role is foundational - without reliable data infrastructure, everything else stalls.

### ML Engineer

Designs, trains, evaluates, and deploys machine learning models. Bridges the gap between research and production. Strong software engineering skills are essential; an ML engineer who cannot write production-quality code creates bottlenecks at deployment.

### Data Scientist

Explores data, develops hypotheses, builds prototype models, and communicates findings. More research-oriented than ML engineers. Best utilized in exploration phases, but the role should not be a permanent "notebook only" position - ensure data scientists can hand off work that is productionizable.

### MLOps Engineer

Manages the infrastructure for model training, deployment, monitoring, and retraining. This is the DevOps equivalent for ML. Critical for production systems but often hired too late - teams try to bolt on MLOps after models are already in production.

### AI Product Manager

Defines what to build, prioritizes the backlog, manages stakeholders, and translates business needs into technical requirements. Must understand AI capabilities and limitations well enough to set realistic expectations and define quantitative success criteria.

### Domain Expert

Provides subject matter expertise for the specific business problem. May be part-time or embedded from the business unit. Essential for evaluation dataset creation, model validation, and defining edge cases. Without domain expertise, the team builds technically impressive solutions that miss the actual business need.

## Team Size and Composition

**Minimum viable AI team: 3 people.** One ML engineer, one data engineer, one part-time product manager. This team can deliver a single AI project from data to production. Below three people, progress is too slow and there is no redundancy.

**Effective project team: 5-7 people.** Two ML engineers, one data engineer, one software engineer (for APIs and integration), one product manager, access to domain experts. This team can sustain a steady delivery cadence.

**Scaling beyond 7.** Split into multiple teams organized by product area or capability (e.g., one team for NLP, one for computer vision). Each team should be independently capable of delivering end-to-end. Shared infrastructure is maintained by the platform team.

## Reporting Structure

**Option 1: Report to Engineering.** AI team reports to the VP of Engineering or CTO. Advantages: tight integration with software delivery, access to engineering infrastructure. Risk: AI work gets deprioritized in favor of feature delivery.

**Option 2: Report to Data.** AI team reports to a Chief Data Officer or VP of Data. Advantages: alignment with data strategy, easier data access. Risk: disconnection from product delivery and engineering practices.

**Option 3: Report to a dedicated AI/ML leader.** AI team reports to a VP of AI, Head of ML, or Chief AI Officer. Advantages: AI gets dedicated advocacy and budget. Risk: organizational isolation; the AI team becomes a silo that other teams view as separate.

The best reporting structure depends on where AI sits in your strategy. If AI is a product differentiator, it needs dedicated leadership. If AI supports internal operations, embedding under engineering or data is sufficient.

## Common Mistakes

**Hiring researchers when you need engineers.** PhD researchers are valuable for novel algorithm development. Most enterprise AI projects need engineers who can build production systems. Match hiring to the actual work.

**No data engineering.** Hiring ML engineers without data engineers means the ML engineers spend 70% of their time on data work they are not expert at and do not enjoy.

**Siloed teams with no integration point.** Multiple teams building AI independently without shared standards, infrastructure, or knowledge sharing. This produces inconsistent quality and duplicated effort.

**All senior, no junior.** Senior AI engineers are expensive and scarce. A team of all seniors is unsustainable. Build a mix with clear mentorship paths for junior members.

Team structure is not permanent. Revisit it as your AI practice matures, as the number of practitioners grows, and as the organization's AI ambitions evolve.
