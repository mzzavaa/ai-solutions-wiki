Most AI proofs of concept never reach production. Industry estimates suggest 80-90% of AI POCs fail to deploy. The gap between "it works in a notebook" and "it runs reliably in production" is wider than most teams expect. This guide covers the specific challenges of the POC-to-production journey and how to navigate them.

## Why POCs Fail to Deploy

**The POC solved the wrong problem.** The POC demonstrated technical feasibility but did not address a real business need with enough impact to justify production investment.

**The POC used unrealistic conditions.** Clean data, curated examples, no edge cases. Production data is messier, more variable, and includes scenarios the POC never encountered.

**The POC was not designed for production.** Notebook code, manual steps, hardcoded paths, no error handling, no monitoring. The gap between POC code and production code is too large to bridge economically.

**No one planned for production.** The POC was funded as an experiment. When it succeeded, there was no budget, timeline, or team allocated for production engineering.

**Integration was underestimated.** The POC existed in isolation. Integrating with existing systems (authentication, data pipelines, APIs, monitoring) was more work than building the model.

## Designing POCs for Production

Build POCs with production in mind from the start:

**Define success criteria before building.** What accuracy metric, at what threshold, would justify production investment? What business metric would need to improve by how much? Write this down before starting.

**Use realistic data.** Run the POC on data that is representative of production. If production data has missing values, noise, and edge cases, the POC data should too.

**Build evaluation infrastructure.** Create a test dataset and evaluation pipeline during the POC. This infrastructure is reused in production monitoring.

**Document everything.** Document the approach, assumptions, data sources, preprocessing steps, model architecture, and results. This documentation accelerates production engineering.

**Consider production constraints during the POC.** If production requires sub-200ms latency, verify that the model can meet this during the POC, not after six months of development.

## The Decision Gate

After the POC, make an explicit go/no-go decision:

**Go if:**
- The model meets the accuracy threshold on realistic data
- The business value justifies the production engineering investment
- The team has (or can acquire) the skills for production deployment
- Data is available and can be maintained for ongoing operation
- The organization is prepared for change management

**No-go if:**
- Accuracy is below the minimum viable threshold
- The business case does not justify the ongoing operational cost
- Critical data dependencies cannot be maintained
- The problem is better solved with traditional software

**Conditional go if:**
- Accuracy is close but not at threshold (bounded effort to close the gap)
- Data quality issues are identified but addressable
- Integration complexity needs further assessment

## The Production Engineering Phase

### Code Quality

**Refactor from notebook to production code.** Extract functions, add type hints, write tests, handle errors, and structure the code as a proper software project.

**Version control everything.** Code, data processing scripts, model configurations, evaluation datasets, and infrastructure definitions all belong in version control.

**Write tests.** Unit tests for data transformations, integration tests for the pipeline, and evaluation tests that verify model quality. A model deployment without tests is a production incident waiting to happen.

### Data Pipeline

**Build automated data ingestion.** Replace manual data loading with automated pipelines that handle scheduling, error recovery, and data validation.

**Implement data validation.** Check every data input for schema compliance, completeness, and expected distributions. Reject bad data before it reaches the model.

**Handle data freshness.** Ensure data is up to date. A model serving predictions based on stale data is serving stale predictions.

### Model Serving

**Choose the right serving pattern.** Real-time (API endpoint), near-real-time (streaming), or batch (scheduled processing). Match the pattern to the business requirement.

**Implement health checks.** The model endpoint should respond to health check requests so load balancers and monitoring can verify it is operational.

**Handle errors gracefully.** What happens when the model receives unexpected input? When a dependency is unavailable? When the model cannot produce a confident prediction? Define fallback behavior for each scenario.

### Monitoring

**Model quality monitoring.** Track prediction accuracy over time. Detect drift. Alert when quality degrades.

**Infrastructure monitoring.** Track latency, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization.

**Business metrics monitoring.** Track the business metrics the AI system is supposed to improve. If business metrics do not improve after deployment, the AI system is not delivering value regardless of model accuracy.

### Deployment Strategy

**Canary deployment.** Deploy to a small percentage of traffic first. Monitor for problems. Expand gradually.

**Rollback capability.** Always be able to revert to the previous model version quickly. Test the rollback process before you need it.

**Shadow mode.** Run the new model alongside the current system without affecting users. Compare outputs to validate behavior before switching.

## Timeline and Effort

A realistic timeline from completed POC to production:

| Phase | Duration | Effort |
|---|---|---|
| Production planning | 1-2 weeks | PM, tech lead |
| Code refactoring and testing | 2-4 weeks | ML engineer, software engineer |
| Data pipeline construction | 2-4 weeks | Data engineer |
| Infrastructure and deployment | 2-3 weeks | DevOps/MLOps engineer |
| Integration testing | 1-2 weeks | Full team |
| Monitoring setup | 1-2 weeks | MLOps engineer |
| Staged rollout | 2-4 weeks | Full team |
| **Total** | **11-21 weeks** | |

This means production engineering typically takes 2-4 times as long as the POC itself. Budget for it from the start.

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping the decision gate.** Moving directly from POC to production without a clear decision and resource commitment. This leads to half-built production systems.

**Underestimating integration.** "Just connect it to the API" is never simple. Authentication, error handling, data format negotiation, and performance tuning all take time.

**No operational plan.** Who monitors the model? Who retrains it? Who investigates when it breaks? If these questions are unanswered at deployment, the model will degrade unnoticed.

**Treating deployment as the end.** Production deployment is the beginning of operations, not the end of the project. Budget for ongoing monitoring, maintenance, and improvement.

The POC-to-production journey is where AI projects succeed or fail. The technical work is necessary but not sufficient - organizational commitment, realistic planning, and disciplined engineering practices are what bridge the gap.
