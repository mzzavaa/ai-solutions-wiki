If you have tried an AI assistant and found the output "technically correct but somehow not quite right," you are experiencing the gap between a model with general knowledge and one grounded in your specific context. The fix is not a better prompt. The fix is your own data.

## The Problem With Generic Output

Large language models are trained on broad internet data. They know how to write a marketing email, a project proposal, or a meeting summary - but in a generic, averaged-out style that reflects no specific voice, no institutional knowledge, and no awareness of your audience, your history, or your terminology.

Prompting helps at the margins. You can instruct the model to "write formally" or "focus on ROI" and get marginally better output. But prompt instructions cannot substitute for context. The model does not know that your company uses a specific approval framework, that your main client contact prefers bullet points over prose, or that the project had a difficult Q2 that shaped the current quarter's priorities.

## Five Stages of Context Richness

Think of your AI usage as a spectrum from zero to fully grounded:

**Stage 1 - Bare model** - No context, generic prompt. Output: plausible but generic. Good for exploring capabilities.

**Stage 2 - Instructed model** - System prompt with persona, tone, and style guidelines. Output: more consistent, still lacks factual grounding.

**Stage 3 - Session context** - Relevant documents pasted into the conversation. Output: grounded in those documents for this session. Does not persist.

**Stage 4 - Retrieved context (RAG)** - Documents retrieved automatically based on the query. Output: grounded in the right material without manual pasting. Scales to large knowledge bases.

**Stage 5 - Fine-tuned or deeply grounded model** - Model trained or grounded on your proprietary data and workflows. Output: deeply aligned with your context, language, and reasoning patterns.

Most organizations operate at stages 1-2 and wonder why the output is not good enough. The step that makes the biggest difference is moving to stage 3 or 4.

## The Personal Inference Pack

A practical concept for teams getting started: assemble a "Personal Inference Pack" - a curated set of documents that represent the context your AI needs for a specific task.

For a proposal writer, this might be: the company capability statement, three recent successful proposals, the client's RFP, notes from discovery conversations, and your standard pricing table. Loading these into a NotebookLM project or an Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base means every generated section is grounded in actual company materials, actual client requirements, and actual past examples.

The NotebookLM demo approach illustrates this well: users who load their own documents - product specs, research notes, past reports - get output that is specifically relevant to their work, not a generic version of what that document type usually says.

## Building Toward RAG

For persistent, team-scale grounding, RAG is the production architecture. Documents are indexed in a vector store; at query time, the most relevant sections are retrieved and included in the model's context automatically.

The investment for a basic RAG implementation is higher than assembling a manual context pack - typically 20,000-50,000 EUR for a focused implementation - but the scale and consistency benefits justify it for teams doing high volumes of AI-assisted knowledge work.

## What This Looks Like in Practice

A document review team that moves from "paste the contract and ask Claude to summarize it" to a RAG system grounded in their contract templates, precedents, and client-specific terms sees output quality improve substantially - not because the model got smarter, but because it now has the context it needs to apply its capability to the actual situation.
