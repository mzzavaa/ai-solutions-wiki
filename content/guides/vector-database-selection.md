Vector databases store and search high-dimensional embeddings, enabling similarity search for RAG systems, recommendation engines, and semantic search. The vector database market has exploded with options, making selection confusing. This guide provides a structured approach to choosing the right one for your use case.

## When You Need a Vector Database

You need a vector database when your application requires finding items similar to a query based on meaning rather than exact matching. Common use cases include RAG (finding relevant documents for LLM context), semantic search (finding content by meaning), recommendation (finding similar items or users), and image search (finding visually similar images).

You may not need a dedicated vector database if your dataset is small (under 100K vectors), your queries are infrequent (a few per minute), or you are already using a database that supports vector search (PostgreSQL with pgvector, OpenSearch with k-NN).

## Selection Criteria

### Scale Requirements

**Vector count.** How many vectors will you store? Under 1 million: most options work. 1-100 million: need a database designed for scale. Over 100 million: need distributed architecture.

**Query throughput.** How many queries per second? Under 10 QPS: any option works. 10-1000 QPS: need proper indexing and caching. Over 1000 QPS: need horizontal scaling.

**Dimensionality.** Embedding dimensions affect storage and search performance. 384-768 dimensions (common for text embeddings) are manageable for all options. 1536+ dimensions (OpenAI embeddings) require more storage and may be slower to search.

### Performance Requirements

**Latency.** Sub-10ms for real-time applications (chatbots, search). Sub-100ms for near-real-time. Seconds for batch processing.

**Recall accuracy.** Approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search trades accuracy for speed. Most applications tolerate 95-99% recall. If you need exact results, use brute-force search (only feasible at small scale).

### Operational Requirements

**Managed vs self-hosted.** Managed services reduce operational burden but cost more and may have less flexibility. Self-hosted gives full control but requires infrastructure expertise.

**Filtering.** Many applications need to combine vector search with metadata filters (find similar documents in category X, published after date Y). Some databases handle this natively; others require workarounds.

**Updates.** How frequently are vectors added or updated? Some databases handle real-time updates well; others are optimized for batch loading.

## Options Overview

### Purpose-Built Vector Databases

**Pinecone.** Fully managed, serverless option available. Strong filtering support. Simple API. Good for teams that want zero operational burden. Limited customization.

**Weaviate.** Open source with managed cloud option. Supports hybrid search (combining vector and keyword search). Built-in support for various embedding models. More complex to operate than Pinecone but more flexible.

**Qdrant.** Open source with managed cloud. Written in Rust for performance. Strong filtering capabilities. Good documentation and growing community.

**Milvus.** Open source, designed for massive scale. Distributed architecture supports billions of vectors. More complex to operate. Cloud-managed version (Zilliz Cloud) available.

**Chroma.** Open source, focused on simplicity. Good for prototyping and smaller deployments. Embedded mode runs in-process. Less mature for production at scale.

### Vector Search in Existing Databases

**PostgreSQL + pgvector.** Add vector search to your existing PostgreSQL database. No new infrastructure. Performance is adequate for small to medium datasets. Scaling requires PostgreSQL scaling expertise.

**Amazon OpenSearch.** k-NN plugin supports vector search alongside traditional search. Good choice if you already use OpenSearch for logging or search.

**Redis.** Vector search module adds similarity search to Redis. Extremely fast for datasets that fit in memory.

**Elasticsearch.** Dense vector field type supports approximate k-NN search. Good for organizations already using Elasticsearch.

## Decision Framework

**Choose Pinecone if** you want zero operational burden, your scale is moderate (under 100M vectors), and you are willing to pay for convenience.

**Choose pgvector if** your dataset is under 5M vectors, you already use PostgreSQL, and you want to avoid adding new infrastructure.

**Choose OpenSearch if** you are on AWS, need both keyword and vector search, and want a managed service (Amazon OpenSearch Service).

**Choose Weaviate if** you need hybrid search, want open source with cloud option, and have moderate operational expertise.

**Choose Milvus if** you need massive scale (100M+ vectors), have strong infrastructure expertise, and need distributed architecture.

**Choose Qdrant if** you want strong performance with good filtering, prefer open source, and have moderate operational expertise.

**Choose Chroma if** you are building a prototype, want the simplest possible setup, and will migrate to a production option later.

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Define Requirements

Document your requirements for vector count, query throughput, latency, filtering needs, update frequency, and operational constraints.

### Step 2: Shortlist

Based on requirements, select 2-3 options that fit. Do not evaluate more than three - the evaluation effort scales linearly.

### Step 3: Benchmark

Load a representative dataset (at target scale if possible) and run benchmark queries:
- Measure query latency at p50, p95, and p99
- Measure recall accuracy against brute-force results
- Measure indexing throughput
- Test filtered queries with your actual filter patterns
- Test under concurrent load matching expected production traffic

### Step 4: Evaluate Operationally

For each shortlisted option, evaluate:
- How hard is it to set up and configure?
- How does it handle failures (node failure, disk full)?
- What is the backup and restore process?
- How does it scale (vertically, horizontally)?
- What monitoring and observability are available?

### Step 5: Cost Comparison

Compare total cost of ownership including:
- Infrastructure costs (instances, storage, network)
- Managed service fees (if applicable)
- Engineering time for operation and maintenance
- Migration cost if you outgrow the solution

The right vector database is the one that meets your performance and operational requirements at acceptable cost. For most teams starting out, the simplest option that meets requirements is the best choice - you can migrate later if needs change.
