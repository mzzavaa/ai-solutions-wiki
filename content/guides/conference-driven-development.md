Conference-driven development is not a formal methodology — it is a practice pattern that technical practitioners discover when they notice that conference deadlines produce different work than internal ones. A talk with a live audience creates three forcing functions simultaneously: a fixed non-negotiable deadline, a simplicity constraint (a 30-minute demo cannot be a complex system), and accountability through public questioning. These constraints reliably turn 80%-done prototypes into finished, explicable systems.

This guide covers the practical engineering decisions involved in conference-driven development for AI systems: how to structure demos that won't fail on stage, how to use talk preparation as a design forcing function, and how the developer relations feedback loop accelerates learning.

## Why Conference Deadlines Work

Internal deadlines are negotiable. A talk slot at a conference is not — cancellation carries professional cost, and the audience expects working demonstrations. This difference is psychologically significant but also structurally meaningful.

Martin Fowler's concept of the **software spike** is relevant here: a time-boxed investigation into a technical question, producing a prototype whose purpose is to answer that question rather than to be production-ready. Conference talks function as public spikes with an externally enforced time box. The forced scope reduction that comes from fitting a demo into a 20–40 minute slot is equivalent to the constraint that makes spikes valuable: you cannot explore everything, so you explore the most important thing.

The talk also forces **articulation**. The cognitive work of explaining a system to an audience who did not build it reveals assumptions and gaps that solo development allows to persist. Richard Feynman's observation — that you do not understand something until you can explain it simply — maps directly to the experience of preparing an AI system talk: you discover what you actually understand versus what you assumed you understood.

## Demo Architecture for AI Talks

Live AI demos fail for predictable reasons. Designing against those failure modes is an engineering problem, not a presentation problem.

### The Fallback Ladder

Production AI systems have latency that is acceptable in applications but long in a live demo context. A 3-second inference call that is invisible in a chat interface is uncomfortable silence on stage. Design a fallback ladder:

1. **Live demo with real inference** — preferred; demonstrates actual system behavior
2. **Pre-computed responses cached by input** — serve deterministic outputs for the demo inputs; the system runs but responses are fast and predictable
3. **Recorded walkthrough** — video of the system operating correctly; no live inference; acceptable as absolute fallback

The cache-based approach (option 2) is underused. It preserves the interactivity of a live demo while eliminating latency and API failure risk. The implementation is simple: hash the demo inputs, store expected outputs, return cached outputs when a hash match is found in a demo environment variable.

```python
import hashlib, os, json

DEMO_CACHE = json.load(open("demo_cache.json")) if os.getenv("DEMO_MODE") else {}

def cached_inference(prompt: str, run_fn):
    key = hashlib.sha256(prompt.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
    if key in DEMO_CACHE:
        return DEMO_CACHE[key]
    return run_fn(prompt)
```

### Environment Isolation

Demo environments must be isolated from production and from development environments that accumulate state. Specific requirements:

- **Seeded random state** — any stochastic components should use fixed seeds in demo mode so output is reproducible across rehearsals
- **Offline capability** — if the venue wifi fails, the demo should still run (use local model serving where possible)
- **Visible state** — print or display the actual system inputs and outputs during the demo; audiences cannot verify that a system is working if they cannot see what it is processing

### Data Selection

Use data that is visually or conceptually immediate. Abstract embeddings are hard to explain live; document classification, image recognition, or structured output generation are easier to follow. If your system operates on proprietary data, prepare a sanitized dataset that is representative in structure but shareable. Toy data (the classic "movie reviews sentiment" dataset) reads as unconvincing; use realistic data from the problem domain.

## Structuring the Talk

AI conference talks that explain both a problem and a technical approach follow a reliable structure:

1. **The problem** (2–3 minutes): State the problem in concrete terms. What breaks without your approach? What does failure look like?
2. **The naive approach and why it fails** (3–5 minutes): Show what a simpler solution does wrong. This grounds the architecture decision that follows.
3. **Your approach** (10–15 minutes): The demo lives here. Walk through the system operating on real inputs. Show the code, the architecture, the output.
4. **What does not work** (3–5 minutes): Honest treatment of limitations, failure cases, and open problems. This is the highest-signal section for technical audiences — it distinguishes practitioners from marketers.
5. **What to take away** (2 minutes): A pattern, a mental model, or a code snippet the audience can apply.

The "what does not work" section is not optional for a credible AI talk. The field has a significant marketing-to-reality gap, and audiences with engineering experience detect it. A talk that acknowledges where the system fails is more trustworthy and more useful than one that does not.

## The Feedback Loop

Conference talks generate several compounding outputs:

**Questions from the audience** are the most valuable output. They identify the assumptions in your design that are not obvious to experienced engineers who did not build the system. Each substantive question from the floor is a signal about what your documentation and API design need to explain more clearly.

**Slide content** is draft documentation. A well-structured talk slide deck already contains most of the content needed for a guide or README: the problem statement, the architecture diagram, the key decision points, and the trade-off analysis. The slides exist because the talk forced you to produce them; converting them to written documentation requires adding prose context, not re-deriving the content.

**Network connections** surface people who have the same problem. In AI, where many production patterns are discovered independently by practitioners in different organizations and rarely written up, conference connections are often how practitioners learn that a pattern they invented already has a name and a community.

## Open-Source Strategy

Releasing the demo system as open source after the talk amplifies the feedback loop. The GitHub repository becomes the reference implementation that people return to when implementing the same pattern. Issues and pull requests surface edge cases and alternative approaches that no talk Q&A session reaches.

The timing matters: release the repository at the talk, not before. Pre-talk release risks scooping the narrative; post-talk release loses the moment of maximum attention. For AI demos, the repository should include:

- The demo environment setup (a `demo_cache.json` and a `DEMO_MODE` environment variable)
- A `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` with pinned dependencies
- A `README.md` that explains the talk's core problem and approach
- The sanitized demo dataset

## When Not to Give a Talk

Conference-driven development has costs. Preparing a good 30-minute talk on a technical topic takes 20–40 hours of preparation for an experienced speaker; more for a first talk. The demo must be finished before the talk slot, not during — which means accepting talk slots on ideas that are genuinely prototyped, not just planned.

The timing heuristic for AI talks: a technique is most valuable to conference audiences when it is 6–18 months old. Early enough to be novel to most practitioners; late enough that you have honest production experience and can speak to failure modes. Talks about techniques that are 3 months old tend to be theoretical; talks about techniques that are 3 years old tend to be explaining what practitioners already know.
