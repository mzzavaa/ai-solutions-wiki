AI services introduce API design challenges that traditional request-response APIs do not face. Responses take seconds rather than milliseconds. Outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic. Payloads can be enormous. Designing APIs that handle these characteristics well requires deliberate choices around streaming, versioning, error handling, and timeout strategies.

## Origins and History

REST API design principles were formalized by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation at UC Irvine, which defined the architectural constraints of Representational State Transfer [1]. The OpenAPI Specification (originally Swagger, created by Tony Tam in 2011) standardized how HTTP APIs are described and documented [2]. Server-Sent Events (SSE) were standardized as part of HTML5 by the W3C and became a WHATWG living standard, providing a simple mechanism for server-to-client streaming over HTTP [3]. When OpenAI released their Chat Completions API in March 2023 with SSE-based streaming, it established a de facto pattern that most AI API providers subsequently adopted. The combination of these established web standards with the unique requirements of LLM inference created the modern landscape of AI API design.

## Streaming Responses

LLM inference can take several seconds for a full response. Streaming tokens as they are generated using Server-Sent Events dramatically improves perceived latency. The client receives the first token in hundreds of milliseconds rather than waiting seconds for the complete response.

Design the API to support both streaming and non-streaming modes via a request parameter. For streaming, send each chunk as an SSE event with a JSON payload containing the token delta. Include a final event with usage metadata (token counts, latency) so clients can log costs without a separate call.

## Versioning AI APIs

AI APIs change more frequently than traditional APIs because model upgrades alter output behavior even when the interface stays the same. Use explicit versioning in the URL path or headers. Pin consumers to specific model versions and provide a migration window when introducing breaking changes. Document behavioral changes (not just schema changes) in version notes, since a model upgrade that changes tone or accuracy is a breaking change from the consumer's perspective.

## Error Handling for Probabilistic Systems

Traditional APIs return errors for invalid inputs. AI APIs must also communicate uncertainty. Use structured error responses that distinguish between system errors (model unavailable, rate limit exceeded), input errors (context too long, unsupported language), and quality warnings (low confidence, content filtered, incomplete response due to token limit).

Return HTTP 200 for successful inference even when the model's confidence is low. Use response metadata fields to signal quality issues rather than HTTP error codes. Reserve 4xx and 5xx for actual failures.

## Timeout and Idempotency Strategies

Set generous timeouts for AI endpoints compared to traditional services. A 30-second timeout that works for CRUD APIs will cause spurious failures for complex inference requests. Use client-generated idempotency keys so that retries after timeouts do not produce duplicate processing or duplicate charges.

For long-running inference, consider an asynchronous pattern: accept the request, return a job ID immediately, and let the client poll or receive a webhook when the result is ready.

## OpenAPI Specification for AI Endpoints

Document AI endpoints with OpenAPI, including response schemas that account for variable output structures. Use `oneOf` or `anyOf` to describe responses that may contain different content types (text, tool calls, image URLs). Document rate limits in the specification using extension fields so consumers can build appropriate retry logic.

## Authentication Patterns

Use API keys for server-to-server calls and OAuth 2.0 for user-facing applications. Scope keys to specific models or capabilities so that a compromised key for a low-cost model cannot be used to run expensive inference. Rotate keys through a gateway layer rather than embedding them in application code.
