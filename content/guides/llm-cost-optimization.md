LLM inference costs add up fast. A customer-facing application processing thousands of requests per hour can easily generate six-figure monthly bills. The good news is that most LLM deployments have significant optimization opportunities. The key is reducing cost without degrading the quality your users experience.

## Measure Before Optimizing

Before cutting costs, instrument your system to understand where money goes. Track per-request costs by breaking down input tokens, output tokens, and model used. Identify your most expensive use cases, your highest-volume endpoints, and your average prompt size. Optimization without measurement is guesswork.

## Prompt Optimization

**Reduce prompt length.** Every token costs money. Audit your system prompts for redundancy, excessive examples, and unnecessary instructions. A system prompt that shrinks from 2000 tokens to 800 tokens saves 60% on input costs for every request.

**Optimize few-shot examples.** If you include examples in your prompts, test whether fewer examples achieve the same quality. Often two well-chosen examples work as well as five.

**Compress retrieved context.** In RAG systems, the retrieved documents dominate input token count. Summarize or extract relevant passages rather than including entire documents. Rank by relevance and include only the top results.

## Caching

**Exact match caching.** Cache responses for identical prompts. This is most effective for applications with repetitive queries: FAQ bots, document classification, and template-based generation. Even a modest cache hit rate dramatically reduces costs.

**Semantic caching.** Cache responses for semantically similar prompts. When a new query is sufficiently similar to a cached query, return the cached response. This requires careful threshold tuning to balance cache hits against response quality.

**KV cache reuse.** For self-hosted models, reuse key-value caches across requests that share prompt prefixes. This reduces computation for the shared portion. Effective when many requests use the same system prompt.

## Model Routing

Not every request needs your most capable (and expensive) model. Implement a router that directs requests to the appropriate model based on complexity:

**Simple requests** (classification, extraction, short answers) go to smaller, cheaper models. A well-prompted small model often matches a large model on straightforward tasks.

**Complex requests** (multi-step reasoning, creative generation, nuanced analysis) go to the most capable model available.

**Router implementation.** Start with rule-based routing (task type, input length) and evolve to a classifier that estimates task difficulty. Monitor quality by model tier to ensure routing decisions are not degrading user experience.

## Batching and Async Processing

**Batch non-urgent requests.** If requests do not need real-time responses, batch them and process during off-peak hours or with batch API pricing, which is typically 50% cheaper.

**Parallelize where possible.** For complex tasks that involve multiple LLM calls (planning, critique, refinement), evaluate whether all steps are necessary. Sometimes a single well-crafted prompt replaces a multi-step chain.

## Output Optimization

**Limit output tokens.** Set max_tokens to the minimum needed for your use case. A classification task does not need 4096 output tokens.

**Use structured output.** JSON mode or function calling produces more concise outputs than free-form text, reducing output token costs.

**Stop sequences.** Configure stop sequences to end generation as soon as the useful output is complete, rather than letting the model generate unnecessary closing text.

## Infrastructure Optimization

For self-hosted models:

- **Right-size GPU instances.** Profile your model's actual VRAM and compute requirements rather than over-provisioning.
- **Use quantized models.** 4-bit or 8-bit quantization reduces memory requirements and increases throughput with minimal quality loss for most applications.
- **Autoscale aggressively.** Scale down during low-traffic periods. LLM serving infrastructure is expensive when idle.
- **Consider spot/preemptible instances** for batch processing workloads that can tolerate interruption.

## Monitoring Cost Continuously

Add cost tracking to your observability stack. Alert on cost anomalies (a new feature that unexpectedly triples token usage) and track cost per user action as a key metric alongside latency and quality.
