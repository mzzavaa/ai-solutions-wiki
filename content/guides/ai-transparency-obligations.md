Transparency is a cross-cutting requirement across multiple EU regulations affecting AI. This guide consolidates transparency obligations from the EU AI Act, GDPR, and related frameworks to help organizations build comprehensive transparency practices.

## EU AI Act Transparency Requirements

The EU AI Act imposes transparency obligations at multiple levels.

**All AI systems interacting with humans** must disclose that the user is interacting with an AI system, unless this is obvious from the context. This applies to chatbots, voice assistants, and any system where a user might reasonably believe they are interacting with a human.

**AI-generated content** - Systems that generate synthetic audio, image, video, or text must mark outputs as artificially generated in a machine-readable format. Deepfakes must be disclosed. Exceptions exist for content that is obviously artistic or satirical.

**High-risk AI systems** carry the most extensive transparency obligations. Providers must supply deployers with clear instructions for use covering the system's intended purpose, known limitations, accuracy metrics, and conditions that may affect performance. Deployers must inform individuals that they are subject to a high-risk AI system and provide meaningful information about the decision.

**General-purpose AI models** require providers to publish a sufficiently detailed summary of the training data content.

## GDPR Transparency Requirements

GDPR Articles 13 and 14 require that data subjects be informed about automated decision-making, including meaningful information about the logic involved, the significance, and the envisaged consequences. Article 22 adds the right to human intervention, the right to express a point of view, and the right to contest automated decisions.

In practice, this means providing layered explanations: a concise notice at the point of data collection, a more detailed privacy notice explaining the AI processing, and the ability to request a specific explanation of an individual decision.

## Practical Implementation

**User-facing disclosure** - Clearly label AI interactions. For chatbots, display "You are chatting with an AI assistant." For AI-generated content, include visible and machine-readable markers. For AI-assisted decisions, inform the subject before the decision is made.

**Decision explanations** - Implement explainability tools (SHAP, LIME, counterfactual explanations) that can generate per-decision explanations. Create templates for different audiences: simple language for data subjects, technical detail for regulators, and comprehensive documentation for auditors.

**Technical documentation** - For high-risk AI systems, maintain documentation covering the system description, development methodology, training data, performance metrics, risk management measures, and human oversight arrangements. This documentation must be available to regulators on request.

**Training data transparency** - For general-purpose AI models, prepare a training data summary describing the data sources, data types, and any filtering or preprocessing applied. The summary should be sufficiently detailed for downstream providers to assess suitability.

## Building a Transparency Framework

Establish organizational standards for AI transparency. Define which AI systems require which level of disclosure. Create reusable explanation templates and disclosure notices. Build transparency requirements into the AI development lifecycle so that documentation and explanation capabilities are designed in from the start rather than retrofitted. Train customer-facing staff to handle AI-related questions from individuals exercising their rights.

Audit transparency practices regularly. Test whether explanations are actually meaningful to their intended audience. Verify that AI interaction disclosures are visible and understandable. Ensure documentation stays current as systems evolve.
