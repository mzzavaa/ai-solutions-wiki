Releasing AI models to production carries risks that application code releases do not. A code bug usually produces an error; a model bug produces a wrong answer that looks correct. Users may not notice degraded performance until the business impact is significant. This guide covers release strategies that manage these risks.

## Why Model Releases Are Different

**Silent failures.** A model that returns a valid but incorrect prediction does not trigger an error. The system looks healthy while making wrong decisions.

**Performance is statistical.** A new model may improve overall accuracy but regress on a specific segment. Aggregate metrics can mask segment-level problems.

**Rollback is not instant.** If the new model requires new features, rolling back the model also requires reverting the feature pipeline. Plan the rollback path before the release.

**Dependencies are bidirectional.** A model release may depend on updated preprocessing code, and the preprocessing code may depend on the new model's expected input format. Coordinate these releases carefully.

## Release Strategies

### Shadow Mode

Deploy the new model alongside the production model. Both models receive the same production traffic, but only the current model's predictions are used. The new model's predictions are logged for comparison.

**When to use:** First production deployment of a new model, major architecture changes, or any release where the team has low confidence in production performance.

**Duration:** Run shadow mode for at least one full business cycle (typically 1-2 weeks) to capture weekday/weekend patterns and any periodic variations.

**Evaluation:** Compare the new model's predictions against the production model's predictions and, when available, against ground truth labels. Look for systematic differences, segment-level regressions, and latency impacts.

### Canary Releases

Route a small percentage of production traffic (1-5%) to the new model. Monitor key metrics. If the canary performs well, gradually increase traffic. If it degrades, route all traffic back to the current model.

**When to use:** Incremental model updates (retraining on fresh data, minor architecture changes) where the team has moderate confidence.

**Monitoring:** Track prediction distribution, latency, error rates, and business metrics for canary traffic separately from production traffic. Automated alerting should trigger rollback if canary metrics deviate beyond thresholds.

**Progression:** 1% for 1 hour, 5% for 4 hours, 25% for 24 hours, 100%. Adjust based on traffic volume and metric stability.

### A/B Testing

Split traffic between the current model and the new model, with users consistently assigned to one variant. Measure business outcomes (conversion rate, revenue, customer satisfaction) rather than just model metrics.

**When to use:** When the business impact of the model change needs to be measured, not just the model performance. A model with higher accuracy may not improve business outcomes if users do not trust or act on the predictions differently.

**Duration:** Run until statistical significance is reached. For business metrics with high variance, this may take weeks.

### Blue-Green Deployment

Maintain two identical production environments. Deploy the new model to the inactive environment, validate it, and switch traffic. The old environment remains available for instant rollback.

**When to use:** When near-zero-downtime deployment is required and rollback must be instantaneous.

## Rollback Procedures

Every model release must have a documented rollback plan:

1. **Rollback trigger criteria** - What metrics must degrade, by how much, for how long before rollback is triggered
2. **Rollback steps** - Specific commands or automation to revert to the previous model version
3. **Feature pipeline rollback** - If the new model required feature changes, document how to revert feature pipelines
4. **Communication** - Who to notify when a rollback occurs
5. **Post-rollback analysis** - Template for investigating what went wrong

Automate rollback whenever possible. A human-initiated rollback during an incident is slower and more error-prone than an automated one triggered by monitoring thresholds.

## Model Release Checklist

Before releasing any model to production:

- [ ] Model validation passes on holdout test set
- [ ] Bias and fairness checks pass across all defined segments
- [ ] Inference latency meets SLA in staging environment under load
- [ ] Shadow mode or canary results reviewed and approved
- [ ] Rollback procedure documented and tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards and alerts configured for new model version
- [ ] Model card updated with performance metrics and known limitations
- [ ] Stakeholders notified of release timeline and expected behavior changes
