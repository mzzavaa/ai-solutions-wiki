When each ML team builds its own training infrastructure, deployment pipeline, and monitoring stack, the organization wastes engineering effort on solved problems while each team's infrastructure remains fragile. An internal AI platform provides shared, reliable infrastructure that lets data scientists and ML engineers focus on models rather than plumbing.

## When You Need a Platform

You need a platform when multiple teams are building ML systems and you observe repeated patterns: each team setting up its own experiment tracking, each team building its own deployment pipeline, each team debugging its own GPU allocation issues. If you have one ML team working on one model, a platform is premature.

## Platform Components

**Compute layer.** Managed access to CPUs and GPUs for training and inference. This includes job scheduling (submit a training job, get results), autoscaling (scale inference endpoints based on traffic), and resource quotas (prevent one team from monopolizing cluster resources). Kubernetes with GPU operators is the common foundation.

**Experiment tracking and model registry.** A shared MLflow or equivalent instance where all teams log experiments and register models. Shared infrastructure here enables cross-team model discovery and consistent governance.

**Feature store.** A centralized feature store (covered in its own guide) that enables feature sharing across teams and ensures training-serving consistency.

**Training pipeline orchestration.** A system for defining and running multi-step ML workflows: data processing, feature computation, training, evaluation, and registration. Kubeflow Pipelines, Airflow, or Step Functions are common choices.

**Model serving.** A standardized way to deploy models as API endpoints with autoscaling, monitoring, and traffic management. Support multiple serving frameworks (TensorFlow Serving, Triton, vLLM) behind a consistent interface.

**Monitoring and observability.** Shared dashboards, alerting, and logging infrastructure tailored for ML workloads: prediction quality metrics, drift detection, cost tracking, and GPU utilization alongside standard application metrics.

**Data access layer.** Governed access to training data, feature data, and evaluation datasets. This includes data catalogs, access controls, and data versioning.

## Design Principles

**Self-service with guardrails.** Teams should be able to launch training jobs, deploy models, and configure monitoring without filing tickets. But enforce guardrails: resource limits, security policies, and governance requirements built into the platform rather than enforced through process.

**Opinionated defaults, escape hatches.** Provide a default, well-supported path for common workflows. A team that follows the golden path gets experiment tracking, deployment, and monitoring for free. But allow teams with unusual requirements to customize or bring their own tools.

**Platform as product.** Treat your internal teams as customers. Gather feedback, prioritize features based on impact, maintain documentation, and provide support. A platform that nobody uses because it is too hard or too rigid is worse than no platform.

**Incremental adoption.** Do not mandate migration. Build the platform, prove its value with one or two early-adopter teams, and expand based on demonstrated benefits. Forced migration creates resentment and rushes integration.

## Build vs. Buy vs. Assemble

Few organizations build everything from scratch. The typical approach is to assemble managed services and open-source tools into a coherent platform:

- Use a cloud provider's managed Kubernetes for compute
- Deploy MLflow or W&B for experiment tracking
- Use a managed feature store or deploy Feast
- Build custom tooling only for organization-specific workflows

The platform team's primary job is integration and developer experience, not building infrastructure components from scratch.

## Measuring Platform Success

Track adoption metrics (how many teams use the platform, how many models are deployed through it), efficiency metrics (time from experiment to deployment, infrastructure cost per model), and satisfaction metrics (developer experience surveys, support ticket volume). A successful platform should show increasing adoption and decreasing time-to-production over its first year.
