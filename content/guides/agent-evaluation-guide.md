AI agents are harder to evaluate than simple prompt-response systems because their behavior involves multi-step planning, tool use, and state-dependent decisions. An agent might solve a problem correctly through five different tool-call sequences, or fail catastrophically by taking an irreversible action on step three of eight. Traditional evaluation metrics do not capture this complexity.

## What Makes Agent Evaluation Different

**Non-deterministic paths.** The same task can be completed through multiple valid sequences of actions. Evaluating only the final result misses important information about how the agent reached it.

**Compounding errors.** Each step in an agent's execution depends on previous steps. A small error early in the sequence can cascade into complete task failure.

**Side effects.** Agents that interact with external systems (APIs, databases, file systems) produce real side effects. Evaluation must account for unintended consequences, not just task completion.

**Cost variability.** Different execution paths consume different amounts of tokens, time, and API calls. Two agents that both complete a task correctly may have vastly different costs.

## Evaluation Dimensions

**Task completion.** Did the agent achieve the stated goal? This is the most fundamental metric. For well-defined tasks, compare the final state against expected outcomes. For open-ended tasks, use human judgment or LLM-as-judge to assess whether the goal was met.

**Action correctness.** Were the individual actions taken by the agent appropriate and correct? Evaluate tool calls for correct parameters, appropriate sequencing, and relevance to the task. An agent that completes the task but makes unnecessary API calls or accesses data it should not is problematic even if the outcome is correct.

**Efficiency.** How many steps, tokens, and tool calls did the agent use? Compare against a reference solution or baseline. Excessive steps indicate poor planning or unnecessary exploration.

**Reliability.** Run the same task multiple times. How often does the agent succeed? What is the variance in approach and outcome? Production agents need high reliability, not just occasional success.

**Safety and guardrails.** Does the agent stay within its authorized scope? Does it refuse tasks it should not perform? Does it ask for confirmation before irreversible actions? Does it handle errors gracefully without retrying destructively?

**Robustness.** How does the agent perform with ambiguous instructions, incomplete information, unexpected tool responses, or adversarial inputs? Test edge cases systematically.

## Building an Evaluation Suite

**Define test scenarios.** Create a diverse set of tasks spanning easy (single tool call), medium (multi-step with clear path), and hard (ambiguous, multi-tool, requiring reasoning). Include scenarios where the correct action is to refuse or ask for clarification.

**Create ground truth.** For each scenario, define the expected outcome and, where possible, acceptable action sequences. Allow for multiple valid paths.

**Implement sandboxed execution.** Agents that interact with external systems need sandbox environments for evaluation. Mock APIs, test databases, and isolated file systems prevent evaluation runs from causing real-world side effects.

**Automate trajectory analysis.** Log every step the agent takes (tool calls, reasoning, intermediate results) and evaluate the full trajectory, not just the final output. Automated checks can flag unauthorized tool use, excessive retries, or access to out-of-scope resources.

## Evaluation Methods

**Unit testing for tools.** Test each tool independently to verify it handles valid inputs, invalid inputs, and error conditions correctly. Tool failures should not crash the agent.

**Scenario-based testing.** Run the full agent through predefined scenarios and evaluate outcomes against success criteria. This is the backbone of agent evaluation.

**Regression testing.** Maintain a suite of previously passing scenarios and run them after every agent change. Agents are sensitive to prompt changes, model updates, and tool modifications.

**Adversarial testing.** Attempt to trick the agent into taking unauthorized actions, leaking information, or exceeding its scope. This overlaps with red teaming but focuses specifically on agent-specific vulnerabilities like tool misuse.

**Production monitoring.** In production, track task completion rates, average step counts, error rates by tool, cost per task, and user satisfaction. Compare against evaluation benchmarks to detect degradation.

## Continuous Improvement

Use evaluation failures to improve the agent iteratively. Categorize failures by root cause: planning errors, tool selection errors, parameter errors, reasoning errors, and safety failures. Address the most common failure categories first, add failing cases to your regression suite, and re-evaluate after changes.
