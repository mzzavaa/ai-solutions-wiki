AI infrastructure that works for a prototype or pilot often breaks down as usage grows. A single model serving endpoint handles the pilot's 100 requests per day but fails at 10,000 requests per day. A training pipeline that runs on a single GPU takes a week when the dataset grows 10x. Scaling AI infrastructure requires deliberate planning across compute, data, and operational dimensions.

## Scaling Model Serving

### Vertical Scaling

Increase the capacity of individual serving instances:
- **Larger instances.** Move from ml.m5.large to ml.m5.4xlarge. More CPU and memory per instance.
- **GPU instances.** Move from CPU to GPU inference for models that benefit from GPU acceleration (large transformers, vision models).
- **Model optimization.** Quantize the model (FP32 to INT8), prune unnecessary parameters, or use a smaller model variant. This increases throughput per instance without changing hardware.

Vertical scaling is simple but has limits. Eventually, you need horizontal scaling.

### Horizontal Scaling

Run multiple instances behind a load balancer:
- **Auto-scaling.** Configure auto-scaling based on metrics: CPU utilization, request queue depth, or custom metrics (inference latency). SageMaker endpoints and ECS services both support auto-scaling.
- **Scaling policies.** Use target tracking (maintain 70% CPU utilization) or step scaling (add 2 instances when queue exceeds 100 requests). Target tracking is simpler and sufficient for most workloads.
- **Minimum instances.** Set a minimum instance count to avoid cold start delays during traffic spikes. For latency-sensitive applications, keep at least 2 instances warm.
- **Maximum instances.** Set a maximum to cap costs. A runaway scaling event can generate enormous bills.

### Request Batching

Group multiple inference requests into a single batch for processing. Most ML frameworks process batches more efficiently than individual requests:
- **Dynamic batching.** Collect requests for a short period (10-50ms) and process them together. SageMaker and Triton Inference Server support this natively.
- **Trade-off.** Batching adds latency (waiting to fill the batch) but increases throughput. Tune the batch window based on your latency tolerance.

### Model Caching

For applications with repeated queries (search, recommendations), cache model outputs:
- **Result caching.** Cache the model's output for specific inputs. Use Redis or ElastiCache. Set TTL based on how quickly results become stale.
- **Embedding caching.** Cache computed embeddings for documents or entities. Embeddings change only when the underlying data changes, so long TTLs are appropriate.

## Scaling Training

### Distributed Training

When training data or model size exceeds single-GPU capacity:

**Data parallelism.** Split the training data across multiple GPUs. Each GPU processes a different batch and gradients are synchronized. Works well for most model sizes that fit on a single GPU.

**Model parallelism.** Split the model across multiple GPUs when it does not fit on a single GPU. Each GPU holds a portion of the model. Required for very large models but adds significant complexity.

**SageMaker distributed training.** SageMaker provides managed data parallelism and model parallelism libraries that handle the distributed training complexity. Specify the number of instances and SageMaker manages distribution.

### Training Pipeline Scaling

**Parallel experiment execution.** Run multiple training experiments simultaneously. Instead of testing hyperparameters sequentially, run them in parallel on different instances.

**Spot instances.** Use spot instances for training to reduce costs by 60-90%. Implement checkpointing to recover from spot instance interruptions.

**Efficient data loading.** Slow data loading is a common bottleneck. Use SageMaker Pipe mode to stream data directly from S3 during training, avoiding the need to download the full dataset.

## Scaling Data Infrastructure

### Feature Store Scaling

As feature count and query volume grow:
- **Online store scaling.** DynamoDB auto-scales read capacity. Redis can scale with cluster mode. Monitor latency and provision ahead of demand.
- **Offline store scaling.** Use columnar storage (Parquet) with partitioning for efficient query performance. Partition by date for time-series features.

### Vector Database Scaling

As document count grows:
- **Sharding.** Distribute vectors across multiple shards. Most vector databases support automatic sharding.
- **Replica sets.** Add read replicas for query-heavy workloads.
- **Index tuning.** Adjust HNSW parameters (M, ef_construction) for the right recall-latency tradeoff at scale.

### Data Pipeline Scaling

- **Parallel processing.** Use Spark, Dask, or Ray for distributed data processing. Scale worker count based on data volume.
- **Incremental processing.** Process only new or changed data instead of reprocessing everything. Reduces processing time and cost.
- **Stream processing.** For real-time data, use Kinesis, Kafka, or managed streaming services. Scale consumers with partition count.

## Cost Management at Scale

Scaling AI infrastructure without cost management leads to budget surprises:

**Monitor cost per prediction.** Track the cost to serve each prediction and the cost to train each model version. These unit economics determine whether the AI system is financially viable at scale.

**Reserved capacity.** For predictable workloads, commit to Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for 30-60% savings over on-demand pricing.

**Right-sizing automation.** Implement automated analysis of instance utilization. Downsize over-provisioned instances. AWS Compute Optimizer provides recommendations.

**Shut down idle resources.** Development endpoints, notebook instances, and training clusters that are not actively used should be stopped automatically. Implement schedules and idle detection.

**Cost allocation.** Tag all AI resources by team, project, and environment. Track costs per AI project to understand the true cost of each initiative.

## Operational Scaling

As AI systems scale, operational practices must scale too:

**Centralized monitoring.** Use a unified monitoring platform (Datadog, CloudWatch, Grafana) for all AI workloads. Avoid fragmented monitoring across services.

**On-call rotation.** Establish on-call procedures for AI production systems. Define escalation paths and runbooks for common issues.

**Automated remediation.** Implement automatic responses to common problems: restart failed endpoints, scale out on queue buildup, trigger retraining on drift detection.

**Capacity planning.** Forecast infrastructure needs based on business growth. Plan GPU capacity 3-6 months ahead because cloud GPU availability can be constrained.

Scaling AI infrastructure is an ongoing practice, not a one-time project. Build with scaling in mind from the start, monitor usage patterns as they evolve, and invest in automation that reduces the per-workload operational burden.
