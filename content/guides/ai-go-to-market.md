Launching an AI product differs from launching traditional software because user expectations must be carefully managed. Users expect software to work correctly every time. AI products make mistakes, and the launch strategy must position this reality as acceptable while still demonstrating clear value. This guide covers the go-to-market playbook for AI products.

## Pre-Launch Positioning

### Define the Value Proposition

AI products succeed when they solve a specific problem measurably better than the alternative. The value proposition should be concrete:

- **Weak:** "AI-powered document processing"
- **Strong:** "Reduce invoice processing time from 15 minutes to 30 seconds with 95% accuracy, with human review for the remaining 5%"

The strong version sets an accuracy expectation, acknowledges the human-in-the-loop requirement, and quantifies the time savings. Customers can calculate ROI from this statement.

### Position the AI Appropriately

**Avoid overpromising.** "Our AI understands your documents" implies comprehension it does not have. "Our AI extracts and classifies data from structured documents with 95% accuracy" is honest and verifiable.

**Lead with the outcome, not the technology.** Customers buy outcomes, not models. "Process invoices 30x faster" resonates more than "powered by a fine-tuned transformer model."

**Acknowledge limitations upfront.** State what the product does well and where it needs human oversight. This builds trust and prevents the inevitable backlash when users discover the limitations themselves.

## Early Adopter Program

### Selecting Early Adopters

Choose early adopters who have the problem you solve, the technical maturity to integrate, and the patience to work through issues. Ideal early adopters:

- Have a quantifiable pain point that your product addresses
- Have a technical team capable of API integration
- Are willing to provide detailed feedback (not just "it does not work" but "it misclassifies receipts as invoices when the header is ambiguous")
- Understand that AI products improve over time and are willing to participate in that improvement

### Running the Beta

**Start with human-in-the-loop.** Even if the product is designed for full automation, launch the beta with human review of all AI outputs. This catches errors before they reach production workflows and builds a labeled dataset for model improvement.

**Instrument everything.** Log every prediction, every user correction, every override. This data drives model improvement and provides evidence for the GA launch business case.

**Weekly feedback cycles.** Meet with each beta customer weekly. Review their usage data, discuss accuracy on their specific data, and prioritize improvements based on their feedback.

**Set a beta timeline.** Typically 8-12 weeks. Define exit criteria: minimum accuracy on customer data, API stability, documentation completeness, and customer willingness to continue at GA pricing.

## Launch Phases

### Limited Availability (LA)

Open to a controlled number of customers (10-50). Pricing may be discounted. SLAs are relaxed. The goal is to validate the product in diverse real-world environments and identify failure modes that the beta did not surface.

**LA exit criteria:** Accuracy metrics met across LA customers, infrastructure handles LA-scale load, support playbooks cover common issues, and at least 3 customer testimonials secured.

### General Availability (GA)

Open to all customers. Full pricing applies. SLAs are committed. The product is positioned as production-ready.

**GA readiness checklist:**
- Product documentation complete (API docs, model card, integration guides)
- Support team trained on common issues and escalation paths
- Monitoring and alerting covers all critical metrics
- Incident response procedure documented and tested
- Pricing and billing system tested at scale
- Legal review of terms of service, data processing agreements, and liability clauses

## Managing Expectations Post-Launch

**Accuracy will vary by customer.** A model trained on general data will perform differently on each customer's specific data. Set expectations that initial accuracy may be lower than advertised and will improve with customer-specific data.

**Publish a product status page.** Show model performance metrics, uptime, and known issues. Transparency builds trust.

**Communicate model updates.** When the model improves, tell customers. When accuracy degrades, tell customers before they notice. Proactive communication about both good and bad news builds the credibility that AI products need to retain customers.

## Scaling the GTM

**Customer success drives expansion.** For AI products, the best growth channel is existing customers expanding usage. If the product delivers measurable value, customers will bring it to new use cases, departments, and workflows.

**Build a feedback loop from sales to product.** Every lost deal and every churned customer provides signal about what the product needs. AI products improve through data, and customer feedback is the most valuable data source for product direction.

**Content marketing with specifics.** Case studies with real numbers ("Customer X reduced processing time by 80% and errors by 60%") are more credible than generic AI marketing. Invest in quantified case studies as the primary marketing asset.
