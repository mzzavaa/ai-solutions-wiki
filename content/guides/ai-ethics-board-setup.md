An AI ethics board provides structured oversight for AI systems that affect people. Without one, ethical decisions default to individual engineers or product managers who lack the context, authority, or diverse perspectives needed to evaluate societal impact. An ethics board does not slow down development; it catches problems before they reach production, where they are far more expensive to fix.

## Origins and History

Formal ethics review for technology traces back to Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), established under the U.S. National Research Act of 1974 to oversee human subjects research. The application of ethics boards to AI specifically gained momentum after high-profile failures: ProPublica's 2016 investigation of racial bias in the COMPAS recidivism algorithm, and Amazon's 2018 disclosure that its AI recruiting tool discriminated against women [1]. The OECD adopted its AI Principles in May 2019, establishing the first intergovernmental standard for trustworthy AI, emphasizing transparency, accountability, and human oversight [2]. IEEE published Standard 7000-2021, providing a model process for addressing ethical concerns during system design [3]. The EU AI Act, adopted in 2024, codified requirements for human oversight of high-risk AI systems under Article 26, making ethics governance a legal obligation for many organizations [4].

## Board Composition

Diversity of perspective is non-negotiable. Include members from:

- **Technical leadership** who understand model capabilities and limitations
- **Legal and compliance** who track regulatory requirements across jurisdictions
- **Domain experts** from affected business areas (HR for hiring tools, medicine for clinical AI)
- **External voices**: ethicists, civil society representatives, or advocates from communities affected by the AI system
- **Product and business leadership** who understand commercial pressures and can weigh tradeoffs

Aim for 5-9 members. Fewer lacks diversity; more becomes unwieldy. Rotate external members every 2 years to prevent groupthink.

## Charter Development

The charter defines the board's authority, scope, and operating procedures. It must answer:

- **Scope**: Which AI systems require board review? Define thresholds based on risk: systems affecting employment, credit, healthcare, or criminal justice always require review. Low-risk internal tools may not.
- **Authority**: Can the board block deployment, or only advise? Advisory boards get ignored under deadline pressure. Grant blocking authority for high-risk systems.
- **Cadence**: Meet monthly for ongoing oversight. Convene ad hoc reviews for new high-risk deployments or incidents.
- **Documentation**: All decisions, dissents, and rationale must be recorded and retained.

## Review Processes

Structure reviews around a standard assessment template:

1. **System description**: What does the AI system do? Who is affected?
2. **Data review**: What data was used for training? Are there known biases or gaps?
3. **Impact assessment**: What are the potential harms? Who bears the risk?
4. **Mitigation measures**: What safeguards exist? How are they monitored?
5. **Ongoing monitoring plan**: How will the system be evaluated post-deployment?

Require teams to submit the assessment before the review meeting. Board members review in advance and arrive prepared with questions.

## Escalation Procedures

Define clear escalation paths. When a team member identifies an ethical concern, they should be able to raise it without going through their manager. Provide a direct channel to the ethics board. For urgent issues (discovered bias in a production system, data breach involving training data), define a fast-track process: convene a quorum within 48 hours with authority to suspend the system pending full review.

Document escalation outcomes and feed them back into the review criteria to prevent recurrence.
