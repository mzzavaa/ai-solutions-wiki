Most machine learning work starts in notebooks. A data scientist trains a model, evaluates it, and declares success. Then comes the hard part: getting that model into production and keeping it running. MLOps is the set of practices that bridges this gap, applying DevOps principles to the unique challenges of machine learning systems.

## Why Notebooks Are Not Enough

Notebooks are excellent for exploration but poor for production. They hide state in execution order, resist version control, lack testing infrastructure, and make dependency management difficult. A model that works in a notebook may fail in production because of subtle differences in data preprocessing, library versions, or execution environment.

The first step in MLOps maturity is recognizing that a trained model is not a product. A product requires reproducible training, automated testing, monitoring, and a deployment pipeline.

## MLOps Maturity Levels

**Level 0 - Manual process.** Data scientists train models manually, hand off artifacts to engineers, and deployment is a one-time event. Most organizations start here.

**Level 1 - ML pipeline automation.** Training is automated end-to-end: data ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment happen through a pipeline. Retraining can be triggered by a schedule or data change.

**Level 2 - CI/CD for ML.** The pipeline itself is versioned and tested. Changes to training code, feature engineering, or model architecture go through automated testing before merging. Model deployment is automated with rollback capability.

## Building Your First ML Pipeline

Start by extracting your notebook code into modular scripts. Each stage of your workflow becomes a separate, testable component:

**Data validation** - Before training begins, validate that incoming data meets expected schemas, distributions, and quality thresholds. Catching data issues early prevents wasted compute and silent model degradation.

**Feature engineering** - Move feature transformations out of notebooks into versioned, tested code. This ensures the same transformations apply during training and serving, preventing training-serving skew.

**Training** - Parameterize your training script so hyperparameters, data paths, and model architecture choices are configuration, not hardcoded values. Log every training run with its parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

**Evaluation** - Define evaluation criteria before training, not after. Include both aggregate metrics (accuracy, F1) and slice-based analysis (performance on subgroups). Set minimum thresholds that a model must pass before deployment.

**Deployment** - Package the model with its dependencies and preprocessing logic. Use containerization to ensure environment consistency. Implement canary or shadow deployments to validate production behavior before full rollout.

## Essential Tooling

You do not need every tool on day one. Start with:

- **Version control** for all code, configuration, and pipeline definitions (Git).
- **Experiment tracking** to log runs, metrics, and artifacts (MLflow, Weights & Biases).
- **A model registry** to store approved model versions with metadata (MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker Model Registry).
- **Container orchestration** for reproducible environments (Docker, Kubernetes).
- **A pipeline orchestrator** to define and run multi-step workflows (Airflow, Step Functions, Kubeflow Pipelines).

## Common Pitfalls

**Over-engineering early.** You do not need a Kubernetes cluster for your first production model. Start with the simplest deployment that meets your reliability requirements and add complexity as needs grow.

**Ignoring data management.** Teams invest in model versioning but neglect data versioning. If you cannot reproduce the exact dataset a model was trained on, you cannot reproduce the model.

**Treating ML deployment like software deployment.** Software behaves deterministically. ML models degrade as the world changes. You need monitoring that goes beyond uptime and latency to track prediction quality over time.

**Skipping testing.** ML pipelines need unit tests (does this function transform data correctly?), integration tests (does the pipeline run end-to-end?), and model tests (does the model meet quality thresholds on held-out data?).

## Where to Go Next

Once your first pipeline is running, focus on drift detection to know when models need retraining, feature stores to share features across models, and automated retraining to reduce the manual burden of keeping models current.
