Scrum is the most widely adopted agile framework, but its standard implementation assumes software engineering workflows. Machine learning teams face different challenges: experiments that cannot be time-boxed reliably, dependencies on data availability, and work that produces insights rather than features. This guide covers how to adapt Scrum specifically for ML teams without losing the framework's benefits.

## Role Adaptations

**Product Owner.** In ML teams, the Product Owner must understand model metrics well enough to define acceptance criteria quantitatively. "The model should be good" is not an acceptance criterion. "Precision above 0.92 at recall above 0.85 on the holdout test set" is. The PO does not need to understand the algorithms, but they must understand what the numbers mean for the business.

**Scrum Master.** The Scrum Master for an ML team needs to understand that blocked work often means "waiting for data" or "training job running for 12 hours," not "waiting for a code review." They should track data pipeline health and compute resource availability as blockers, not just team dependencies.

**Development Team.** ML teams typically include data engineers, ML engineers, and sometimes domain experts or data analysts. The cross-functional nature of Scrum works well here, but be explicit about who can work on what. Not every team member can debug a training pipeline or write a data validation script.

## Sprint Length

Two-week sprints are standard in software Scrum. For ML teams, consider the following:

**Two weeks works for engineering-heavy phases.** When the team is building data pipelines, setting up infrastructure, creating APIs, or implementing monitoring, standard two-week sprints are fine.

**Two weeks is often too short for research.** A meaningful ML experiment - hypothesis formation, data preparation, training, evaluation, analysis - can take one to three weeks. One-week sprints create excessive ceremony overhead; three-week sprints delay feedback.

**The recommendation: keep two-week sprints but allow research stories to span sprints.** Use the sprint boundary as a check-in point, not a hard deadline. A research story that is not complete at sprint end carries over with a status update, not a sense of failure.

## Backlog Structure

The product backlog for an ML team benefits from categorization that standard Scrum does not prescribe:

**Data stories.** Data acquisition, cleaning, labeling, and pipeline work. These are the most predictable and easiest to estimate. Example: "Ingest customer transaction data from the warehouse into the feature store, validated against the schema."

**Experiment stories.** Hypothesis-driven research work. These should include the hypothesis, the evaluation method, and a time cap. Example: "Test whether adding embedding features from product descriptions improves recommendation click-through rate by at least 5%. Time-box: one sprint."

**Engineering stories.** Standard software stories for APIs, infrastructure, monitoring, and integration. Example: "Deploy the model serving endpoint behind the API gateway with authentication and rate limiting."

**Technical debt stories.** Cleanup of hardcoded values, notebook-to-production refactoring, documentation, and test coverage. ML projects accumulate technical debt faster than traditional software, so these need consistent backlog presence.

## Sprint Planning Adaptations

Sprint planning for ML teams should include:

**Data readiness check.** Before committing to any model work, confirm that the required data is available, accessible, and in the expected format. This single check prevents more sprint failures than any other practice.

**Compute resource planning.** Will the team need GPU instances for training? Is there contention with other teams for shared compute? Reserve resources during planning, not mid-sprint.

**Experiment design review.** For research stories, spend five minutes in planning reviewing the experimental design. What is the hypothesis? What is the evaluation method? What constitutes a conclusive result? This prevents experiments that produce ambiguous results.

**Dependency mapping.** ML work has more sequential dependencies than typical software. Feature engineering depends on data pipeline completion. Model training depends on feature engineering. Evaluation depends on an evaluation dataset. Map these explicitly during planning.

## Daily Standup Modifications

The standard three questions (what did you do, what will you do, any blockers) need augmentation:

**Share experiment results.** "Yesterday I trained the model with the new features. AUC improved from 0.78 to 0.81. Today I will try hyperparameter tuning to see if we can push it further." This is more useful than "I worked on the model."

**Report pipeline status.** "The nightly data refresh failed; I am investigating. This blocks the retraining scheduled for today." Data pipeline health is a daily concern for ML teams.

**Flag resource contention.** "My training job needs a GPU instance but the cluster is at capacity. Expected wait time: 4 hours." Resource contention is a blocker unique to ML teams.

## Sprint Review and Demo

Demonstrating ML work to stakeholders requires a different approach than showing a new UI feature:

**Show metrics, not just outputs.** Display accuracy trends across sprints, confusion matrices, and error analysis. Stakeholders may not understand the technical details, so provide business-relevant interpretations: "The model now correctly routes 91% of support tickets, up from 87% last sprint."

**Demo failure analysis.** Show examples where the model fails and explain why. This builds stakeholder trust and helps them understand the model's limitations. "The model struggles with tickets that mention multiple products - here is an example."

**Present experiment summaries.** For research sprints, present what was tried, what was learned, and what the next steps are. A slide showing "three approaches tested, one promising, two eliminated" is a valid sprint review artifact.

## Retrospective Focus Areas

ML team retrospectives should regularly address:

- Estimation accuracy for research stories (were they consistently underestimated?)
- Data quality issues encountered (can we prevent them earlier?)
- Experiment-to-production handoff friction (is notebook code hard to productionize?)
- Cross-functional collaboration (are data engineers and ML engineers communicating effectively?)
- Tool and infrastructure pain points (is the training pipeline reliable?)

## When Scrum Does Not Fit

Scrum works well for teams building production ML systems. It works less well for pure research teams exploring fundamental approaches. If the team's primary output is research papers rather than production models, a lighter framework like Kanban may be more appropriate. The key indicator: if you cannot write meaningful sprint goals with measurable outcomes, Scrum's structure adds overhead without corresponding benefit.

For most enterprise ML teams building production systems, Scrum with the adaptations described here provides the right balance of structure and flexibility.
