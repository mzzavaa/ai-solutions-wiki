AI products require dual metrics tracking: model metrics that measure technical performance and product metrics that measure business outcomes. A model with 95% accuracy is useless if users do not trust or adopt the product. A product with high engagement may be succeeding despite a mediocre model. Tracking both independently reveals where to invest improvement effort.

## Why Dual Tracking Matters

Model metrics and product metrics can diverge in either direction:

**High model performance, low product performance.** The model is accurate but the product fails. Causes: poor UX that hides good predictions, latency that frustrates users, or a solution to a problem users do not actually have.

**Low model performance, high product performance.** The product succeeds despite model limitations. Causes: effective error correction UX, users who value speed over perfection, or a market with no alternatives.

**Correlated improvement.** Model improvements drive product improvements. This is the expected path, but it only works when the right model metric is being optimized. Improving recall when users care about precision will not improve the product.

## Model Metrics

Select model metrics that connect to user experience:

**Task-specific accuracy metrics.** Precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC, NDCG, or domain-specific metrics. Choose metrics that reflect what matters to users. For a spam filter, false positives (legitimate emails blocked) are worse than false negatives (spam getting through). Track precision as the primary metric.

**Confidence calibration.** Are the model's confidence scores meaningful? If the model says it is 90% confident, is it correct 90% of the time? Well-calibrated confidence scores enable better UX decisions (auto-approve high confidence, route low confidence to humans).

**Latency metrics.** p50, p95, and p99 inference latency. Latency directly affects user experience. A recommendation that takes 2 seconds feels broken even if it is accurate.

**Segment-level metrics.** Break model metrics down by user segment, input category, and time period. Aggregate metrics can hide problems. A model that is 95% accurate overall but 70% accurate for a specific input type will frustrate users who encounter that input type.

## Product Metrics

Track product metrics that measure actual user value:

**Adoption metrics.** Active users, feature adoption rate, activation rate (percentage of users who complete a key action within first session). For AI features, track the percentage of users who enable vs disable the AI functionality.

**Engagement metrics.** Session frequency, time on task, and task completion rate. For AI-assisted workflows, measure the time savings compared to the non-AI workflow.

**Trust metrics.** Override rate (how often users change the AI's suggestion), correction rate (how often users provide corrections), and escalation rate (how often users bypass the AI entirely). Declining override rates over time indicate growing trust.

**Outcome metrics.** Revenue impact, cost savings, error reduction, throughput improvement. These are the metrics that justify the AI investment and should be reported to leadership.

## Connecting Model and Product Metrics

Build dashboards that show model and product metrics side by side. Use correlation analysis to identify which model improvements actually improve the product:

**Model accuracy vs user trust.** Plot model accuracy over time alongside override rate. Identify the accuracy threshold at which users begin to trust the system (override rate drops below a target).

**Latency vs engagement.** Plot inference latency against session duration or task completion rate. Identify the latency threshold at which user behavior changes.

**Confidence calibration vs automation rate.** Plot calibration quality against the percentage of predictions that are automatically accepted without human review. Better calibration enables higher automation.

## Metric Dashboards

Structure dashboards in three tiers:

**Executive dashboard.** Business outcomes only: revenue impact, cost savings, user adoption, customer satisfaction. Updated weekly or monthly.

**Product dashboard.** Adoption, engagement, trust, and outcome metrics. Updated daily. Includes trend lines and alerts for significant changes.

**Model dashboard.** Accuracy, latency, drift, fairness, and segment-level metrics. Updated in near-real-time. Includes automated alerting for metric degradation.

## Anti-Patterns

**Optimizing model metrics without product validation.** Improving accuracy from 92% to 94% is meaningless if users cannot tell the difference. Run A/B tests to verify that model improvements translate to product improvements.

**Reporting only aggregate metrics.** "95% accuracy" hides the segment where the model is 60% accurate. Always disaggregate.

**Treating model metrics as product success.** A technically excellent model in a product nobody uses is a failed product. Model metrics are a means to product metrics, not an end in themselves.

**Ignoring qualitative signals.** User interviews, support tickets, and churned user surveys reveal problems that dashboards miss. A user who says "I stopped using the AI because it got my name wrong once" reveals a trust dynamic that no metric captures.
