User acceptance testing for AI systems is fundamentally different from traditional UAT. In traditional software, a test either passes or fails. In AI systems, some failures are expected and acceptable. UAT must verify that the system's error rate is within acceptable bounds and that the user experience handles errors gracefully. This guide covers how to design and execute UAT for AI systems.

## The Core Challenge

Traditional UAT uses deterministic test cases: given input X, expect output Y. AI UAT must accommodate probabilistic outputs where the same input may produce different results, and where a percentage of results will be wrong by design. Stakeholders accustomed to traditional UAT will flag every incorrect prediction as a bug. Setting expectations before UAT begins is essential.

## Pre-UAT Preparation

**Define statistical acceptance criteria.** Before UAT, agree with stakeholders on metrics and thresholds: "The system must correctly classify at least 88% of test cases." This is the acceptance criterion, not 100%.

**Prepare a representative test set.** Curate 200-500 test cases that reflect production conditions. Include easy cases, edge cases, and known difficult cases in proportions that match production. Label every test case with the expected output and the difficulty level.

**Build evaluation tooling.** Create a UAT interface that lets testers review predictions, mark them as correct or incorrect, and optionally provide the correct answer. Aggregate results automatically into the agreed metrics. Do not rely on manual spreadsheet tallying.

**Brief the testers.** Conduct a pre-UAT session explaining how the AI system works, what error rate to expect, and how to report issues. Distinguish between model errors (the model is wrong) and system errors (the system crashed, timed out, or returned malformed data). Both are valid findings, but they have different remediation paths.

## Test Design

### Scenario-Based Testing

Design test scenarios around user workflows, not isolated predictions. A tester should complete a full task: submit an input, review the AI output, take action based on it, and evaluate whether the overall workflow was successful.

Example scenario for a document classification system: "Upload 20 invoices, review the AI classifications, correct any errors, and approve the batch. Measure: how many corrections were needed, how long the overall task took, and whether the user trusted the classifications."

### Stratified Testing

Ensure the test set covers all important strata:

- **Input categories** - If the model handles 12 document types, test all 12, not just the most common 3
- **Edge cases** - Ambiguous inputs, inputs at the boundary between categories, unusually long or short inputs
- **Known failure modes** - Inputs that the model historically misclassifies, tested to verify whether improvements hold
- **Demographic strata** - If the system serves different populations, test across all groups to catch bias

### Error Recovery Testing

Test what happens after the AI is wrong:

- Can the user easily identify the error?
- Can the user correct the error with minimal effort?
- Does the correction mechanism work correctly?
- Is the corrected data captured for future model improvement?

Error recovery is often more important than raw accuracy. A system that is 85% accurate with easy correction may be more acceptable than a system that is 90% accurate with no correction path.

## Execution

**Run UAT in rounds.** Round 1 identifies major issues. Fix them. Round 2 validates fixes and identifies remaining issues. This iterative approach prevents testers from being overwhelmed by a large number of errors in the first round.

**Use blinding where appropriate.** For comparing a new model against the current production model, show testers outputs from both without revealing which is which. This prevents bias toward the familiar system.

**Capture qualitative feedback.** Beyond pass/fail metrics, ask testers: "Do you trust this system enough to use it daily?" "Where did it frustrate you?" "What would make you more confident in its outputs?" These insights are as valuable as the quantitative metrics.

## Acceptance Decision

The acceptance decision should be based on:

1. **Quantitative metrics** meeting the agreed thresholds
2. **No critical system errors** (crashes, timeouts, data corruption)
3. **Error recovery** being functional and usable
4. **User confidence** being sufficient for the intended use (measured through surveys or interviews)

If the system meets the quantitative threshold but testers report low confidence, investigate before accepting. The system may have a pattern of errors that, while within the overall accuracy threshold, concentrates errors in a high-stakes category that damages trust.

Document the UAT results, the acceptance decision, and any conditions (e.g., "accepted for production with the condition that model retraining occurs monthly and UAT is repeated quarterly").
