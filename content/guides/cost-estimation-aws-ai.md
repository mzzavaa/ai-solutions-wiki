AWS AI service costs are notoriously hard to predict. Pricing models vary by service (per-token, per-hour, per-request), costs scale non-linearly with usage, and hidden charges (data transfer, storage, logging) add up quickly. This guide covers how to estimate costs accurately and avoid budget surprises.

## Cost Components

### Foundation Model Inference (Amazon Bedrock)

Bedrock pricing is per-token for on-demand usage:

**Input tokens** are charged at one rate, **output tokens** at a higher rate. For Claude models on Bedrock, input tokens cost roughly $3-$15 per million tokens and output tokens $15-$75 per million tokens, depending on the model variant. Pricing changes frequently, so always check current rates.

**Estimation approach:**
1. Estimate average input size (tokens per request)
2. Estimate average output size (tokens per request)
3. Estimate daily request volume
4. Calculate: (input_tokens x input_price + output_tokens x output_price) x daily_volume x 30

**Example:** 1,000 requests/day, average 500 input tokens and 200 output tokens, using Claude Sonnet:
- Monthly input cost: 500 x 1,000 x 30 x $3/1M = $45
- Monthly output cost: 200 x 1,000 x 30 x $15/1M = $90
- Total: ~$135/month

For higher volumes, Provisioned Throughput offers predictable pricing but requires commitment.

### Model Training (SageMaker)

Training costs depend on instance type, training duration, and data volume:

**Instance costs.** ml.p3.2xlarge (single GPU) runs approximately $3.83/hour. ml.p4d.24xlarge (8 GPUs) runs approximately $37.69/hour. Multi-GPU training is faster but more expensive per hour.

**Estimation approach:** Benchmark a small training run, extrapolate to full dataset size, and add 30% buffer for hyperparameter tuning and failed runs.

**Spot instances** can reduce training costs by 60-90% for fault-tolerant training jobs. Configure checkpointing to avoid losing progress when instances are reclaimed.

### Inference Hosting (SageMaker Endpoints)

Real-time endpoints run continuously and charge by instance-hour:

**Right-sizing matters.** An ml.m5.xlarge ($0.23/hour, ~$170/month) may be sufficient for low-traffic models. An ml.g5.xlarge ($1.41/hour, ~$1,015/month) is needed for GPU-dependent models.

**Serverless inference** charges per-request and eliminates idle costs, but has cold start latency. Suitable for low-traffic or latency-tolerant workloads.

**Auto-scaling** adjusts capacity based on traffic, but you pay for the minimum instance count at all times.

### Data Storage and Transfer

**S3 storage:** $0.023/GB/month for standard tier. Training datasets and model artifacts add up. A 100GB dataset costs ~$2.30/month.

**Data transfer:** Transfer between AWS services in the same region is free for most services. Transfer out to the internet is $0.09/GB. Transfer between regions is $0.02/GB.

**EBS volumes:** SageMaker notebook instances and training jobs use EBS storage. 100GB gp3 volume costs ~$8/month.

### Supporting Services

**CloudWatch logging:** $0.50/GB ingested. AI workloads that log model inputs and outputs can generate significant log volume. A system logging 1,000 requests/day with 1KB average per request: ~1.5GB/month, ~$0.75/month.

**Lambda (for preprocessing/postprocessing):** $0.20 per million requests plus $0.0000166667 per GB-second. Usually a small fraction of total cost.

**OpenSearch (for vector search/RAG):** A t3.medium.search instance costs ~$0.07/hour (~$50/month). For production RAG, plan for 2-3 instances ($100-$150/month minimum).

## Cost Estimation Template

| Component | Estimation Method | Monthly Cost Range |
|---|---|---|
| LLM inference (Bedrock) | Token volume x price per token | $50 - $10,000+ |
| Model training (SageMaker) | Instance-hours x instance price | $100 - $5,000+ |
| Inference hosting | Instance count x instance price x 730 hours | $170 - $3,000+ |
| Storage (S3, EBS) | GB stored x price per GB | $5 - $100 |
| Vector database | Instance type x instance count | $50 - $500 |
| Monitoring and logging | Log volume x ingestion price | $5 - $50 |
| Data transfer | GB transferred x transfer price | $0 - $100 |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

**Start with on-demand, move to commitments.** Use on-demand pricing during development to understand actual usage patterns. Once usage is stable, commit to Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for 30-60% savings.

**Use spot instances for training.** Training jobs that support checkpointing can use spot instances safely. Set up automatic retry on interruption.

**Right-size inference endpoints.** Monitor CPU/GPU utilization on inference endpoints. Most are over-provisioned. An endpoint running at 10% utilization can likely use a smaller instance.

**Implement caching.** Cache LLM responses for repeated queries. If 20% of queries are repeated, caching saves 20% of inference costs.

**Batch inference for non-real-time.** Instead of real-time endpoints, use batch transform for workloads that can tolerate latency. Batch processing is significantly cheaper.

**Monitor continuously.** Set up AWS Cost Explorer alerts for AI-related services. Review costs weekly during development and monthly in production. Cost surprises almost always indicate a misconfiguration or unexpected usage pattern.

The most common cost mistake in AI projects is not monitoring costs during development. A developer who leaves a large training instance running over a weekend can generate thousands of dollars in charges. Implement tagging, alerts, and automatic shutdown policies from day one.
