Product management for AI products requires different skills and approaches than traditional software product management. The core challenge: you cannot guarantee what the product will do. Traditional PMs can promise specific features by specific dates. AI PMs work with probabilistic systems where "the model is correct 92% of the time" is a feature specification, and whether you can reach 95% is genuinely unknown.

## What Changes with AI Products

**Requirements are probabilistic.** Instead of "the system shall display the customer's order history," requirements become "the system shall correctly classify customer intent with at least 90% accuracy." The qualifier "at least" introduces uncertainty that ripples through every planning decision.

**User experience must handle errors gracefully.** Every AI product will make mistakes. The UX must accommodate wrong predictions, provide correction mechanisms, and maintain user trust despite errors. This is fundamentally different from designing for software that works correctly by default.

**Timelines are less predictable.** A software feature can be estimated reasonably by experienced engineers. Whether a model can achieve a specific accuracy target - and how long it will take - is genuinely uncertain until experimentation begins.

**Data is a product requirement.** Every AI feature depends on data availability and quality. The PM must understand data requirements as deeply as they understand user requirements.

## Defining AI Product Requirements

### Functional Requirements

Write requirements that specify the task, the inputs, the outputs, and the quality threshold:

"Given a customer support email in English, the system shall classify it into one of 12 predefined categories with at least 88% accuracy, measured on a representative test set of 500 labeled emails."

Each element matters:
- **Task:** classify customer support emails
- **Input specification:** English language, email format
- **Output specification:** one of 12 categories
- **Quality threshold:** 88% accuracy
- **Evaluation method:** representative test set of 500 labeled emails

### Non-Functional Requirements

AI products have specific non-functional requirements that software PMs may not consider:

**Latency.** How fast must the prediction be? Real-time (under 200ms), near-real-time (under 2 seconds), or batch (can wait minutes or hours)?

**Fairness.** The model must perform equitably across demographic groups. Specify which groups and what "equitable" means quantitatively.

**Explainability.** Can users see why the model made a particular prediction? Is this required by regulation, customer expectations, or internal policy?

**Graceful degradation.** What happens when the model is uncertain? When the model service is unavailable? Define the fallback behavior.

**Data freshness.** How current does the training data need to be? A fraud detection model may need daily retraining; a document classifier may be fine with quarterly updates.

## Success Metrics for AI Products

Traditional product metrics (adoption, engagement, retention) still apply, but AI products need additional metrics:

**Model quality metrics.** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, or task-specific metrics. The PM does not need to compute these but must understand what they mean and set targets.

**User override rate.** How often do users reject or correct the AI's output? A high override rate indicates the model is not meeting user expectations, even if offline accuracy is high.

**Coverage rate.** What percentage of inputs can the model handle confidently? A model that is 99% accurate but only handles 30% of inputs is less useful than one that is 90% accurate and handles 80% of inputs.

**Time savings.** For AI that augments human work, measure the time saved per task. This directly translates to business value.

**Error impact.** Not all errors are equal. A false positive in fraud detection blocks a legitimate customer. A false negative lets fraud through. Understand which errors are more costly and optimize accordingly.

## Managing the AI Product Lifecycle

### Discovery Phase

Validate that the problem is worth solving with AI:
- Is the task currently done by humans? What does it cost?
- Is there enough data to train a model?
- What accuracy would make the AI solution valuable?
- What is the cost of errors?

Many AI product ideas fail this basic validation. The task is too rare (insufficient training data), too nuanced (requires human judgment), or too low-volume (automation savings do not justify the investment).

### Development Phase

Work closely with the engineering team to manage scope:
- Start with the simplest version that delivers value
- Define a minimum viable accuracy, not a stretch target
- Plan for an evaluation framework before building the model
- Expect 2-3 iteration cycles between prototype and production-ready

### Launch Phase

AI products benefit from gradual rollouts:
- **Shadow mode:** the model runs but does not affect users; outputs are compared to the current system
- **Pilot group:** a small group uses the AI-powered feature with close monitoring
- **Gradual rollout:** expand to larger groups while monitoring quality metrics
- **Full launch:** available to all users with monitoring in place

### Maintenance Phase

AI products require ongoing maintenance that software products do not:
- Model quality monitoring (detecting accuracy degradation)
- Regular retraining with fresh data
- Ongoing evaluation against new edge cases
- Feature engineering updates as the domain evolves

The PM must budget for this ongoing work. An AI feature is not "done" at launch - it requires continuous investment.

## Common PM Mistakes in AI

**Promising specific accuracy before experimentation.** Never commit to a performance target without a feasibility study. "We will investigate and share expected accuracy after a 2-week spike" is the right answer.

**Designing the UX assuming the model is always right.** Every AI product needs an error handling strategy. What does the user see when the model is wrong?

**Treating the model as a black box.** PMs who do not understand how the model works cannot make good product decisions. Invest time in understanding the basics: what data does it use, what are its known limitations, what types of errors does it make?

**Ignoring the data flywheel.** AI products can improve over time as they collect more data from production usage. Design feedback mechanisms that capture user corrections and feed them back into model improvement.

AI product management is harder than traditional PM work because of the uncertainty involved. But the fundamentals are the same: understand the user, define the problem, measure success, and iterate relentlessly.
