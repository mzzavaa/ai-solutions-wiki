Monitoring AI systems in production is fundamentally different from monitoring traditional software. Traditional monitoring focuses on "is the system up and responding?" AI monitoring must also answer "is the system still producing good results?" A model can return HTTP 200 with low latency while producing increasingly wrong predictions due to data drift. Without AI-specific monitoring, these failures are invisible until stakeholders complain.

## What to Monitor

### Model Quality Metrics

**Prediction accuracy.** If ground truth labels are available (even with delay), track accuracy, precision, recall, F1, or task-specific metrics over time. A declining trend indicates model degradation.

**Prediction confidence.** Monitor the distribution of model confidence scores. A shift toward lower confidence suggests the model is encountering inputs it was not trained on.

**Prediction distribution.** Track the distribution of model outputs. If a classification model suddenly starts predicting one class much more frequently, something has changed - either the input data or the model's behavior.

**Error analysis.** Categorize and track error types. Are errors concentrated in specific input categories, time periods, or user groups?

### Data Quality Metrics

**Feature drift.** Monitor the statistical distribution of input features over time. Significant distribution shifts (detected via PSI, KS test, or similar methods) indicate that the production data no longer matches the training data.

**Data completeness.** Track the percentage of missing or null values in each input feature. Increasing missing data rates indicate upstream data quality problems.

**Schema violations.** Monitor for unexpected data types, value ranges, or categories. A field that should be numeric receiving string values, or a categorical field receiving values not seen in training, signals a data problem.

**Volume anomalies.** Track the number of predictions per time period. Sudden increases or decreases indicate either real usage changes or upstream system problems.

### Infrastructure Metrics

**Latency.** Track p50, p95, and p99 response times. AI inference latency can vary significantly with input size and model complexity.

**Throughput.** Requests per second handled by the model serving infrastructure. Monitor for capacity limits.

**Error rates.** HTTP errors, timeout rates, and internal model errors. A sudden spike in errors indicates infrastructure problems.

**Resource utilization.** CPU, GPU, and memory utilization of model serving instances. High utilization indicates scaling needs; low utilization indicates over-provisioning and wasted cost.

## Monitoring Architecture

A production AI monitoring system has three layers:

### Data Collection Layer

**Prediction logging.** Log every prediction with: timestamp, input features (or a hash for privacy), model output, confidence score, model version, and latency. Store in a queryable format (CloudWatch Logs, OpenSearch, or a data warehouse).

**Ground truth collection.** When available, collect the actual outcome. For some systems this is immediate (user clicked or did not click); for others it is delayed (loan defaulted after 6 months). Design the collection pipeline early.

**Feature logging.** Log the computed features that were fed to the model. This is essential for debugging training-serving skew.

### Analysis Layer

**Drift detection.** Run statistical tests comparing recent production data to the training data distribution. Common approaches: Population Stability Index (PSI) for overall distribution shift, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for individual feature drift.

**Performance computation.** When ground truth arrives, compute model quality metrics and compare to baseline. Use sliding windows (last 7 days, last 30 days) to detect trends.

**Anomaly detection.** Apply anomaly detection to the monitoring metrics themselves. Sudden changes in prediction distribution, latency, or error rates should trigger investigation.

### Alerting Layer

**Severity levels.** Define clear severity levels:
- **Critical:** Model serving is down or returning errors. Immediate response required.
- **High:** Model quality has degraded below acceptable threshold. Response within hours.
- **Medium:** Data drift detected but model quality is still acceptable. Investigate within days.
- **Low:** Minor anomalies or trend changes. Review in the next monitoring session.

**Alert routing.** Route critical alerts to on-call engineers via PagerDuty or similar. Route medium and low alerts to team channels for review during business hours.

**Alert fatigue prevention.** Too many alerts cause the team to ignore them all. Set thresholds that trigger only when action is needed. Use aggregation to combine related alerts.

## Drift Detection in Practice

Data drift is the most common cause of AI performance degradation. Implement detection at multiple levels:

**Feature-level drift.** Monitor each input feature independently. If customer age distribution shifts from mean 35 to mean 45, that specific feature has drifted.

**Prediction-level drift.** Monitor the distribution of model outputs. A classifier that starts predicting class A for 80% of inputs (up from 50%) has drifted at the output level.

**Concept drift.** The relationship between inputs and correct outputs has changed. This is harder to detect because it requires ground truth. For example, the features that predict customer churn may change after a major product change.

**Detection schedule.** Run drift detection daily for high-volume systems, weekly for lower-volume systems. Compare against a reference window (the training data distribution or a recent known-good period).

## Dashboards

Build dashboards that serve different audiences:

**Operations dashboard.** Real-time. Shows model serving health, latency, error rates, and throughput. Used by on-call engineers.

**Model quality dashboard.** Updated daily or weekly. Shows accuracy trends, drift metrics, and error analysis. Used by ML engineers and data scientists.

**Business dashboard.** Updated weekly or monthly. Shows business metrics influenced by the model (conversion rates, processing times, error costs). Used by stakeholders and product managers.

## Common Monitoring Gaps

**No ground truth pipeline.** The model is monitored for uptime and latency but not accuracy because no one built the pipeline to collect ground truth labels.

**Monitoring only aggregate metrics.** Overall accuracy looks fine, but the model is failing badly for a specific input segment that is a small percentage of total volume.

**No baseline comparison.** Metrics are tracked but there is no reference point. Is 87% accuracy good or bad? Compare to the baseline established during model evaluation.

**Monitoring the wrong things.** Extensive infrastructure monitoring with no model quality monitoring. The model serves fast, wrong answers without anyone noticing.

Production monitoring is not optional infrastructure - it is the safety net that catches the problems AI systems inevitably develop over time. Build it before you deploy the model, not after the first production failure.
