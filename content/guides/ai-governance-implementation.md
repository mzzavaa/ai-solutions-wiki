AI governance is the framework of policies, processes, and organizational structures that ensure AI systems are developed and operated responsibly. Without governance, organizations face regulatory penalties, reputational damage from biased or harmful outputs, and inconsistent practices across teams. With too much governance, innovation stalls. The goal is a proportionate framework that manages risk without creating bureaucratic overhead.

## Governance Structure

**AI governance board.** Establish a cross-functional body with representatives from engineering, legal, compliance, ethics, product, and business leadership. This board sets policy, reviews high-risk AI applications, and resolves escalated decisions. Meet regularly (monthly or quarterly) but enable asynchronous reviews for time-sensitive decisions.

**AI risk classification.** Not every AI application needs the same level of oversight. Define risk tiers based on potential impact:

- **Low risk** - Internal tools, content recommendations, code completion. Lightweight review, standard development practices.
- **Medium risk** - Customer-facing features, automated decisions that affect user experience. Documented review, bias testing, monitoring plan required.
- **High risk** - Decisions affecting employment, credit, healthcare, safety, or legal rights. Full governance review, external audit, human oversight requirements, ongoing monitoring.

**Roles and responsibilities.** Define who is accountable for AI systems at each stage. Model developers own technical quality. Product owners own use case appropriateness. Risk and compliance teams own regulatory adherence. The governance board owns policy.

## Core Policies

**Acceptable use policy.** Define what AI may and may not be used for in your organization. Prohibit uses that violate laws or organizational values. Require human oversight for consequential decisions.

**Data policy for AI.** Specify requirements for training data: consent, licensing, privacy, bias assessment, retention, and deletion. Address synthetic data, web-scraped data, and third-party datasets explicitly.

**Model development standards.** Require documentation (model cards), evaluation against defined metrics, bias and fairness testing, security review, and approval before deployment. Scale requirements based on risk tier.

**Vendor and third-party AI policy.** Establish requirements for evaluating external AI services: data handling, model transparency, liability, compliance certifications, and exit provisions.

**Incident response policy.** Define what constitutes an AI incident, how incidents are reported, escalation procedures, and post-incident review processes.

## Process Implementation

**Intake and risk assessment.** Before any AI project begins, conduct a lightweight assessment to determine risk tier and applicable requirements. Use a standardized questionnaire covering use case, affected populations, data sources, decision impact, and regulatory exposure.

**Development checkpoints.** Insert governance checkpoints at key stages: design review (is this use case appropriate?), pre-deployment review (does the model meet quality and fairness standards?), and post-deployment monitoring plan review.

**Documentation requirements.** Require model cards for all deployed models. Model cards should describe the model's purpose, training data, performance characteristics, limitations, and intended use. For high-risk systems, require more detailed technical documentation.

**Monitoring and audit.** Define what must be monitored post-deployment: performance metrics, fairness metrics, drift indicators, and usage patterns. Conduct periodic audits of high-risk systems, comparing actual behavior against documented intentions.

## Making Governance Practical

**Automate what you can.** Embed governance checks into CI/CD pipelines: automated bias testing, documentation completeness checks, and model evaluation gates. Automated checks scale better than manual reviews.

**Provide templates and tooling.** Teams will comply more readily if you provide model card templates, risk assessment questionnaires, and evaluation frameworks rather than asking them to build governance artifacts from scratch.

**Start small and iterate.** Implement governance for your highest-risk applications first. Learn what works, refine the process, then expand to lower-risk applications. A governance framework that tries to cover everything on day one will be ignored.

**Measure governance health.** Track metrics like time-to-approval, percentage of models with complete documentation, and incident frequency. Use these to identify bottlenecks and demonstrate governance value to leadership.
