Models trained on historical data degrade as the world changes. Customer preferences shift, new products launch, fraud patterns evolve, and language use changes. Continuous training (CT) is the practice of automatically retraining models on fresh data to maintain performance. It is the ML equivalent of continuous deployment in software engineering.

## Retraining Triggers

**Scheduled retraining** is the simplest approach. Retrain daily, weekly, or monthly regardless of whether anything has changed. This works well when data accumulates steadily and the cost of unnecessary retraining is low. Most teams start here.

**Performance-based retraining** triggers when monitoring detects that model quality has dropped below a threshold. This requires ground truth labels, which may arrive with a delay. A fraud model might wait days or weeks for confirmed fraud labels before it can measure true performance.

**Data-drift-based retraining** triggers when the statistical properties of incoming data diverge from the training data distribution. This catches potential problems before they manifest as performance degradation, but can produce false positives.

**Event-based retraining** triggers on business events: a new product category is added, a policy changes, a seasonal shift begins. These require domain knowledge to configure but catch changes that statistical monitoring might miss.

## Pipeline Architecture

A continuous training pipeline automates every step from data to deployed model:

**Data collection** - Pull fresh data from your data warehouse, feature store, or streaming sources. Apply the same data validation checks used in initial training. Reject runs that fail data quality gates.

**Feature computation** - Compute features using the same definitions as the original training. A feature store ensures consistency. Without one, version your feature computation code carefully.

**Training** - Run the same training pipeline with the same hyperparameters (or run a lightweight hyperparameter search). Log the run to your experiment tracker.

**Evaluation** - Compare the new model against the current production model on a held-out test set. Include both aggregate metrics and slice-based analysis. A model that improves overall accuracy but degrades on an important subgroup should not be automatically deployed.

**Promotion gate** - Automated checks determine whether the new model is fit for deployment. Minimum metric thresholds, regression tests on critical slices, latency benchmarks, and fairness checks all serve as gates. If any gate fails, the pipeline stops and alerts the team.

**Deployment** - If all gates pass, promote the new model version in the model registry and trigger deployment. Use canary or shadow deployment to validate production behavior before full rollout.

## Handling the Cold Start Problem

New categories, new user segments, and new products lack historical data. Your continuous training pipeline should account for this by incorporating strategies like transfer learning from related categories, synthetic data augmentation, or rule-based fallbacks until sufficient data accumulates.

## Data Management for Continuous Training

**Training windows** - Decide how much historical data to include. A sliding window (last 90 days) keeps the model current but loses long-term patterns. An expanding window preserves history but may dilute recent trends. Many teams use a weighted approach, giving more importance to recent data.

**Data versioning** - Every retraining run should reference an immutable data snapshot. If a model misbehaves, you need to inspect the exact data it was trained on.

**Label management** - Continuous training requires a steady supply of labeled data. Invest in label pipelines that collect ground truth from production systems (click-through rates, conversion events, confirmed fraud) and feed them back into training datasets.

## Monitoring the Training Pipeline

Monitor the pipeline itself, not just the model. Track training duration, data volume, resource usage, and gate pass/fail rates. A training run that suddenly takes three times longer or uses twice the data may indicate an upstream data issue rather than a model issue.

## Cost Control

Retraining consumes compute. Optimize by retraining only when needed (drift-triggered rather than scheduled), using incremental training when the framework supports it, and right-sizing your training infrastructure. The cost of retraining should be weighed against the cost of serving a stale model.
