Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) continuously monitors cloud environments for misconfigurations, compliance violations, and security risks. AI workloads introduce unique security challenges that standard CSPM configurations miss. This guide covers how to extend CSPM for AI-specific concerns.

## Why CSPM Matters for AI

AI workloads create distinctive security risks in cloud environments. Training data stored in S3 or blob storage may contain sensitive personal data but lack proper access controls. SageMaker notebook instances often have overly permissive IAM roles. GPU instances may be left running after training completes, increasing attack surface and cost. Model serving endpoints may be publicly accessible without authentication. And ML pipeline credentials for data sources and model registries may be hardcoded or stored insecurely.

## Common AI Misconfigurations

**Storage misconfigurations** - Training data buckets without encryption, public access enabled, or overly broad IAM policies. Model artifact stores without versioning or access logging. **Compute misconfigurations** - SageMaker notebooks with internet access and root permissions, GPU instances in public subnets, training jobs without VPC configurations. **Network misconfigurations** - Model inference endpoints accessible from the public internet, missing VPC endpoints for AI services, inadequate network segmentation between development and production AI environments. **Identity misconfigurations** - Service roles with wildcard permissions, shared credentials across ML pipeline stages, long-lived access keys for data access.

## Implementing CSPM for AI

**Step 1: Define AI-specific policies.** Extend your CSPM rule set with AI-specific checks. Examples: SageMaker endpoints must use KMS encryption, Bedrock model invocation logging must be enabled, training job IAM roles must follow least privilege, S3 buckets tagged as training-data must have access logging enabled, and GPU instances must have automatic shutdown configured.

**Step 2: Configure asset discovery.** Ensure your CSPM tool discovers AI-specific resources: SageMaker domains, endpoints, and training jobs; Bedrock model access configurations; GPU instances and their associated storage; ML pipeline resources (Step Functions, Lambda functions); and data pipeline components (Glue jobs, EMR clusters).

**Step 3: Map to compliance frameworks.** Link CSPM findings to regulatory requirements. Training data encryption supports GDPR Article 32 and NIS2 security measures. Access logging supports DORA's record-keeping requirements. Network controls support NIS2's network security requirements. Create compliance dashboards that show posture against each regulation.

**Step 4: Automate remediation.** For clear-cut misconfigurations, implement automated remediation: auto-encrypt unencrypted training data buckets, automatically disable public access on model serving endpoints, terminate orphaned GPU instances after a defined idle period, and revoke overly permissive IAM roles.

**Step 5: Continuous monitoring.** Set up real-time alerting for critical AI security findings. Integrate CSPM alerts with your incident response workflow. Track security posture trends over time. Report CSPM metrics to management as part of overall security reporting.

## Tool Options

AWS-native options include Security Hub, Config rules, and GuardDuty. Azure provides Defender for Cloud. Third-party CSPM platforms like Wiz, Orca, Prisma Cloud, and Lacework provide cross-cloud coverage and often have better AI-specific detection rules. Evaluate tools based on their coverage of AI and ML service configurations specifically, not just general cloud resources.
