AI pipelines handle a concentration of high-value secrets: LLM API keys with per-token billing, cloud credentials with GPU provisioning permissions, database connection strings to training data, and model registry tokens. A leaked API key can generate thousands of dollars in charges within hours. A compromised cloud credential can expose proprietary training data or model weights. Secrets management for AI pipelines requires the same rigor as production web services, with additional considerations for the unique characteristics of ML workflows.

## Origins and History

Secrets management as a formal practice evolved from the broader field of cryptographic key management. The NIST Special Publication 800-57, first published in 2005, established recommendations for key management lifecycle practices [1]. HashiCorp launched Vault in 2015, providing the first widely adopted open-source secrets management platform with dynamic secrets, leasing, and revocation [2]. AWS Secrets Manager followed in 2018, offering managed secrets with automatic rotation for AWS services [3]. As AI pipelines grew more complex, spanning training clusters, experiment tracking systems, model registries, and serving infrastructure, the number of secrets per pipeline multiplied, making manual management untenable.

## Never Commit Secrets

This is the first rule and the most frequently violated. API keys, database passwords, and service account credentials must never appear in source code, configuration files, Jupyter notebooks, or Docker images. Use pre-commit hooks like `detect-secrets` or `gitleaks` to scan for secrets before they enter version control. If a secret is committed, rotate it immediately; deleting the commit from history is not sufficient since the secret may already be in caches, forks, or CI logs.

## Vault Integration

Centralize secrets in a dedicated secrets manager:

**HashiCorp Vault** provides dynamic secrets that are generated on demand with automatic expiration. Instead of a static database password shared across all pipeline stages, Vault generates a unique short-lived credential for each job. If compromised, it expires within hours [2].

**AWS Secrets Manager** integrates natively with SageMaker, Lambda, and ECS. Automatic rotation is supported for RDS credentials, API keys, and OAuth tokens. Use IAM roles to control which pipeline stages can access which secrets [3].

**Azure Key Vault** provides similar capabilities for Azure-native pipelines, with integration into Azure ML workspaces and AKS clusters.

Choose the tool that matches your primary cloud provider. For multi-cloud pipelines, HashiCorp Vault provides provider-agnostic management.

## API Key Rotation

Establish rotation schedules based on risk: LLM API keys every 90 days, cloud credentials every 30 days, database passwords on every deployment. Automate rotation so it happens without human intervention. Design applications to handle rotation gracefully: read secrets at runtime rather than at startup, and implement retry logic for the brief period during rotation when the old key is revoked and the new one is being propagated.

## CI/CD Secrets

CI/CD pipelines are a common secrets leak vector. Never echo secrets in build logs. Use your CI platform's native secrets injection (GitHub Actions secrets, GitLab CI variables, Jenkins credentials) and verify they are masked in output. For training pipelines that run on ephemeral compute, inject secrets as environment variables at runtime through the orchestrator rather than baking them into container images.

## Runtime Injection

Applications should retrieve secrets at runtime, not at build time. Use an init container or sidecar to fetch secrets from the vault and make them available to the application container. For Kubernetes workloads, the Secrets Store CSI Driver mounts vault secrets as files in the pod filesystem, avoiding environment variable exposure in process listings.

## Audit Logging

Log every secret access: who accessed which secret, when, and from where. Secrets managers provide audit logs natively. Feed these logs into your SIEM and set alerts for anomalous access patterns: access from unusual IP ranges, access outside business hours, or sudden spikes in API key usage that may indicate compromise.
