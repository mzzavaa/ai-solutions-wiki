AI systems are hungry for data, and much of the most valuable data contains personal information. Training a healthcare model requires patient records. Building a fraud detection system requires transaction histories. Improving a recommendation engine requires user behavior data. Anonymization techniques allow organizations to extract value from sensitive data while protecting individual privacy. Done poorly, anonymization provides a false sense of security. Done well, it enables AI development that respects both privacy regulations and ethical obligations.

## Origins and History

Data anonymization research accelerated after a series of high-profile re-identification attacks demonstrated that naive approaches fail. In 1997, Latanya Sweeney showed that 87% of the U.S. population could be uniquely identified by combining zip code, birth date, and sex, despite these being considered "anonymous" data points [1]. She formalized k-anonymity in 2002, establishing the first rigorous framework for anonymization [2]. Machanavajjhala et al. extended this work with l-diversity in 2007, addressing k-anonymity's vulnerability to attribute disclosure [3]. Cynthia Dwork introduced differential privacy in 2006, providing a mathematical guarantee of privacy that does not depend on assumptions about attacker knowledge [4]. Apple adopted differential privacy in iOS 10 (2016), and the U.S. Census Bureau used it for the 2020 Census, bringing the technique from theory to large-scale practice [5].

## Formal Privacy Models

**K-anonymity** ensures that every record in a dataset is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records with respect to quasi-identifiers (attributes that could be combined to re-identify someone). A dataset is 5-anonymous if every combination of quasi-identifier values appears at least 5 times. Limitation: all k records may share the same sensitive attribute value, enabling attribute disclosure.

**L-diversity** requires that each equivalence class (group of indistinguishable records) contains at least l well-represented values for each sensitive attribute. This prevents attribute disclosure but can still leak information when the distribution of sensitive values within a group differs significantly from the overall distribution.

**T-closeness** strengthens l-diversity by requiring that the distribution of sensitive attributes within each equivalence class is within distance t of the overall distribution, measured by Earth Mover's Distance.

**Differential privacy** provides the strongest formal guarantee: the output of a query or algorithm changes by at most a bounded amount whether or not any single individual's data is included. The privacy budget parameter epsilon controls the tradeoff between privacy and utility. Smaller epsilon means stronger privacy but noisier results.

## Practical Techniques

**Data masking.** Replace identifying fields with tokens or pseudonyms. Hash email addresses, replace names with random identifiers, truncate IP addresses. Masking is simple but insufficient alone since masked data can still be re-identified through linkage attacks.

**Generalization.** Reduce the precision of quasi-identifiers. Replace exact ages with age ranges (25-30), replace full addresses with regions, round timestamps to the nearest day. Generalization directly supports k-anonymity implementations.

**Synthetic data generation.** Train a generative model on the real data, then generate a synthetic dataset that preserves statistical properties without containing real records. Tools like Gretel, Mostly AI, and SDV implement this approach. Validate that the synthetic data maintains utility for your ML task while passing privacy audits.

**Federated learning.** Rather than centralizing data for anonymization, train models where the data lives. Each participant trains locally and shares only model updates, never raw data. Combine with secure aggregation and differential privacy for defense in depth.

## Choosing the Right Approach

Match the technique to the threat model. If data will be published, differential privacy or synthetic data provides the strongest protection. If data stays internal with access controls, k-anonymity with masking may suffice. For ongoing ML training, federated learning avoids the need to centralize sensitive data at all. In all cases, document the anonymization method, the privacy parameters chosen, and the residual risk.
