AI audits evaluate whether your AI systems are developed, deployed, and operated in compliance with regulatory requirements, industry standards, and internal policies. Audit readiness means having the documentation, processes, evidence, and organizational structure in place before the auditors arrive, not scrambling to assemble them after an audit is announced.

## What Auditors Look For

Auditors evaluate your AI systems across several dimensions. They want to see that you know what AI systems you have, what decisions they make, what data they use, who is responsible for them, and how they are monitored. Specifically, they examine:

**AI system inventory** - A complete registry of all AI systems in use, their purpose, risk classification, responsible owner, and deployment status. You cannot govern what you do not know exists.

**Decision traceability** - The ability to trace any AI-driven decision back to the model version, input data, configuration, and logic that produced it. This requires an immutable audit trail that captures every inference with sufficient context for reconstruction.

**Model documentation** - Model cards or equivalent documentation for every production model, covering intended use, training data, performance metrics, known limitations, and fairness evaluation results. Documentation must be current, not stale from the initial deployment.

**Data governance** - Evidence that training data was collected, processed, and used in compliance with applicable regulations. Data lineage showing the origin and transformation of data used in AI systems. Data protection impact assessments where required.

**Risk management** - A documented risk assessment for each AI system, with controls proportionate to the identified risks. Evidence that risk assessments are reviewed and updated periodically.

**Change management** - Records of all changes to AI systems: model updates, prompt changes, data pipeline modifications, and configuration changes. Evidence that changes go through a review and approval process.

## Building the Evidence Base

Start collecting audit evidence now, not when an audit is announced. Implement automated logging of all AI system decisions, model deployments, and configuration changes. Store audit logs in tamper-evident, append-only storage with defined retention periods. Automate the generation of model cards and system documentation as part of your deployment pipeline.

Create a centralized evidence repository where audit artifacts are organized by AI system and regulatory requirement. Map each artifact to the specific regulatory clause or policy requirement it satisfies. This mapping exercise often reveals gaps that can be addressed before an audit.

## Process Readiness

**Roles and responsibilities** - Document who owns each AI system, who approves model deployments, who monitors production performance, and who is the point of contact for audit inquiries. Auditors will ask to speak with these people.

**Incident response** - Have a documented and tested incident response procedure for AI-related incidents. Auditors want to see that you can detect, respond to, and learn from AI system failures.

**Regular internal reviews** - Conduct periodic internal reviews of your AI systems against your governance policies. Document findings and remediation actions. Internal reviews demonstrate a culture of continuous compliance rather than point-in-time audit preparation.

**Training and awareness** - Maintain records of AI literacy and governance training completed by staff involved in AI development and deployment. The EU AI Act explicitly requires adequate AI literacy.

## Preparing for Specific Frameworks

Different regulatory frameworks emphasize different aspects. The EU AI Act focuses on risk classification, conformity assessment, and transparency obligations for high-risk systems. NIST AI RMF emphasizes risk identification, measurement, and management across the AI lifecycle. ISO/IEC 42001 requires a management system approach with documented policies, objectives, and continuous improvement processes. SOC 2 audits examine controls around security, availability, and confidentiality of AI systems.

Map your audit preparation to the specific frameworks you expect to be audited against. A gap analysis comparing your current state to framework requirements identifies the highest-priority remediation items.

## Common Pitfalls

Treating audit readiness as a documentation exercise rather than an operational practice. Auditors can distinguish between documentation created for the audit and documentation that reflects how the organization actually operates. The goal is not to create artifacts that satisfy auditors but to build operational practices that naturally produce the evidence auditors need.

Failing to include AI systems built with third-party APIs or low-code platforms in the system inventory. If you are using an LLM API to make or influence business decisions, that is an AI system that falls within audit scope regardless of how simple the integration is.
