Prompt chaining is the technique of breaking a complex AI task into a sequence of simpler prompts, where each prompt's output feeds into the next prompt's input. Instead of asking a model to do everything in one shot, you guide it through a structured workflow. This produces more reliable results for complex tasks and makes the system easier to debug, test, and improve.

## Why Chain Prompts

A single complex prompt asking a model to "analyze this document, extract key entities, categorize them, assess sentiment for each, and generate a summary report in JSON" will often fail or produce inconsistent results. The same task broken into five steps - extract, categorize, assess, synthesize, format - produces dramatically better results because:

**Each step is simpler.** The model focuses on one task at a time, reducing the chance of errors.

**Intermediate results can be validated.** After extraction, you can check that entities were found before proceeding to categorization. This prevents errors from propagating.

**Steps can use different models.** A fast, cheap model can handle extraction while a more capable model handles synthesis. This optimizes cost.

**Debugging is easier.** When the final output is wrong, you can examine each intermediate step to find where things went wrong.

## Chain Architecture Patterns

### Sequential Chain

Each step feeds directly into the next: A produces output for B, B produces output for C.

```
Input -> [Extract Entities] -> [Classify Entities] -> [Generate Summary] -> Output
```

**Best for:** Tasks with a clear linear flow where each step builds on the previous one.

### Parallel Chain

Multiple steps run independently on the same input, then results are combined.

```
Input -> [Extract Entities] ----\
Input -> [Assess Sentiment] -----> [Combine Results] -> Output
Input -> [Identify Key Topics] -/
```

**Best for:** Tasks where multiple independent analyses are needed. Parallel execution reduces total latency.

### Conditional Chain

The output of one step determines which subsequent step to execute.

```
Input -> [Classify Intent] -> if "complaint" -> [Handle Complaint]
                           -> if "question"  -> [Answer Question]
                           -> if "feedback"  -> [Process Feedback]
```

**Best for:** Tasks where different input types require different processing paths.

### Iterative Chain

A step is repeated until a quality condition is met.

```
Input -> [Generate Draft] -> [Evaluate Quality] -> if below threshold -> [Refine Draft] -> [Evaluate Quality] -> ...
                                                 -> if above threshold -> Output
```

**Best for:** Tasks where output quality is variable and can be improved through iteration. Set a maximum iteration count to prevent infinite loops.

## Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling

Each step in the chain can fail. Handle failures explicitly:

**Retry with backoff.** If a step fails due to a transient error (API timeout, rate limit), retry with exponential backoff. Limit retries to 3 attempts.

**Fallback prompts.** If the primary prompt produces invalid output, try a simpler prompt that is more constrained. For example, if a structured extraction prompt fails, fall back to a simpler prompt that extracts one field at a time.

**Validation between steps.** Parse and validate each step's output before passing it to the next step. Check for expected format, required fields, and reasonable values. Reject and retry if validation fails.

**Graceful degradation.** If a non-critical step fails after retries, continue with a default value or skip the step rather than failing the entire chain.

### State Management

Complex chains need to manage state across steps:

**Accumulator pattern.** Maintain a running context object that each step reads from and writes to. Each step adds its results to the context, and subsequent steps can access any previous step's output.

**Immutable state.** Treat intermediate results as immutable. Each step reads from previous state and produces new state. This makes debugging easier because you can inspect the state at any point.

### Prompt Design for Chains

**Be explicit about input format.** Each prompt should specify exactly what input it expects. "You will receive a JSON object with the following fields..." prevents ambiguity.

**Be explicit about output format.** Each prompt should specify the exact output format. "Return a JSON object with the following structure..." ensures the output can be parsed by the next step.

**Minimize context.** Each step should receive only the information it needs, not the entire conversation history. This reduces token costs and keeps the model focused.

**Include examples.** Few-shot examples are especially valuable in chains because they demonstrate both the expected input format and output format for each step.

## Optimization

### Latency

Chains add latency because each step requires an API call. Optimize by:
- Parallelizing independent steps
- Using faster models for simpler steps
- Caching results for repeated inputs
- Minimizing the number of steps (each step should earn its place)

### Cost

Each step consumes tokens. Optimize by:
- Using smaller, cheaper models for simpler steps
- Keeping prompts concise
- Caching intermediate results for repeated queries
- Batch processing where possible

### Quality

Improve chain quality by:
- Adding validation between steps to catch errors early
- Using stronger models for critical steps (classification, synthesis)
- Including few-shot examples in each prompt
- Implementing iterative refinement for quality-critical outputs

## Practical Example: Document Analysis Chain

**Step 1: Extract** (fast model). Extract all entities (people, organizations, dates, amounts) from the document. Output: JSON list of entities with types.

**Step 2: Classify** (fast model). Classify the document type (contract, invoice, memo, report) based on content. Output: document type with confidence.

**Step 3: Analyze** (capable model). Given the entities and document type, identify the key relationships and important information. Output: structured analysis.

**Step 4: Summarize** (capable model). Given the analysis, generate a human-readable summary appropriate for the document type. Output: summary text.

**Step 5: Format** (fast model). Format the summary and analysis into the required output template. Output: final formatted result.

Total steps: 5. Steps 1 and 2 can run in parallel. Steps 3-5 are sequential. The chain is testable at each step, and failures in early steps are caught before expensive later steps execute.

Prompt chaining is a fundamental technique for building reliable AI applications. It trades simplicity (single prompt) for reliability (structured workflow), and that trade is almost always worth making for production systems.
