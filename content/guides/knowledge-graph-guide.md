Knowledge graphs represent information as entities and relationships, capturing the structured knowledge that unstructured text and vector embeddings often lose. When integrated with AI systems, knowledge graphs improve reasoning about relationships, enable multi-hop queries, and provide explainable retrieval paths. They complement rather than replace vector-based retrieval.

## When Knowledge Graphs Add Value

Knowledge graphs shine when your domain has rich, well-defined relationships that matter for answering questions. Examples include:

- **Enterprise knowledge management** where you need to traverse organizational structures, project dependencies, and expertise networks
- **Product catalogs** where items have compatibility, substitution, and hierarchy relationships
- **Regulatory compliance** where rules, entities, and obligations form complex relationship networks
- **Scientific and medical domains** where entities (drugs, diseases, genes) have well-documented relationships

If your queries are primarily about finding relevant passages in documents, vector search alone may suffice. If your queries require traversing relationships ("which products are compatible with X that are also approved for use in region Y?"), a knowledge graph adds significant value.

## Designing the Ontology

The ontology defines the types of entities and relationships in your graph. This is the most important design decision.

**Start with use cases.** What questions must the graph answer? Work backward from queries to the entities and relationships needed. An overly broad ontology creates maintenance burden without proportional value.

**Define entity types.** What are the key nouns in your domain? Products, customers, regulations, documents, people, organizations, concepts. Each entity type has a set of properties (name, description, identifiers).

**Define relationship types.** What connections exist between entities? "Reports to," "is compatible with," "is regulated by," "is a subtype of." Each relationship has a type, direction, and optional properties (weight, confidence, effective date).

**Keep it simple initially.** Start with the minimum ontology that supports your priority use cases. You can extend it incrementally. Complex ontologies that try to model everything upfront are difficult to populate and maintain.

## Populating the Graph

**Manual curation** produces the highest-quality data but does not scale. Use it for core ontology elements and high-value entities.

**Structured data import.** Databases, APIs, and structured files can be mapped to entities and relationships. This is the most reliable automated approach and should be your primary population method.

**NLP-based extraction.** Extract entities and relationships from unstructured text using named entity recognition and relation extraction models. Modern LLMs can perform this extraction with reasonable accuracy but require validation. Use confidence thresholds and human review for extracted triples.

**Crowdsourcing and expert annotation.** For domain-specific knowledge that is not available in structured sources, engage domain experts to validate and extend automatically extracted knowledge.

## Graph Database Selection

**Neo4j** is the most mature graph database with strong query language (Cypher), visualization tools, and ecosystem. Good for most use cases.

**Amazon Neptune** is a managed graph database supporting both property graph and RDF models. Good for AWS-centric architectures.

**TigerGraph** focuses on deep-link analytics at scale. Suitable for very large graphs with complex traversal patterns.

## Integrating with AI Systems

**Graph-enhanced RAG.** Use the knowledge graph alongside vector retrieval. When a user asks a question, identify entities in the query, traverse the graph to find related entities and relationships, and include this structured context alongside retrieved text passages. This improves answers that require relational reasoning.

**Query planning.** Use an LLM to translate natural language questions into graph queries (Cypher, SPARQL). The LLM acts as a natural language interface to the graph database.

**Entity resolution.** Use the graph to disambiguate entities mentioned in user queries. When a user says "Apple," the graph's context (relationships to products, people, or fruits) helps determine the intended entity.

## Maintenance

Knowledge graphs require ongoing maintenance: adding new entities as the domain evolves, updating relationships as they change, removing stale information, and resolving conflicting data from different sources. Budget for this maintenance or the graph's value degrades over time.
