Most AI assistants fail not because the underlying model is bad but because the design around the model is bad. Intake is unclear, context is lost between turns, escalation paths do not exist, and there is no mechanism for the system to improve based on what users actually ask. This guide addresses those design problems.

## Intake Design

The first thing an AI assistant needs to do is understand what the user wants. This sounds obvious but most assistant implementations skip it. They start generating responses immediately without confirming they have understood the request correctly.

Good intake design involves:

**Disambiguation before action** - If a request is ambiguous, ask one clarifying question before proceeding. Not a list of questions - one question targeting the most critical ambiguity. "Are you asking about your current policy or filing a new claim?" is useful. A five-field intake form is not.

**Capturing intent, not just words** - "I need help with my bill" could mean: I want to understand a charge, I cannot afford to pay this month, I think there is an error, I want to change my plan. The assistant should identify the underlying intent, not just take the words literally.

**Setting expectations about capabilities** - Tell users what the assistant can and cannot do upfront or at the point where they hit a limit. "I can help you check your account balance and usage. For billing disputes, I will need to connect you with the billing team." This is more useful than letting users discover limits through failed attempts.

## Context Management

Context is what makes an assistant feel like a conversation rather than a series of disconnected responses.

**Session context** - Within a conversation, the assistant should retain everything said. Reference earlier parts of the conversation rather than asking users to repeat themselves. If the user mentioned their account number in turn 3, do not ask for it again in turn 7.

**User context** - Between sessions, the assistant should retain relevant persistent information: account details, prior interactions, stated preferences, ongoing cases. Authenticated users should not have to re-explain their situation on every contact.

**Domain context** - The assistant should be loaded with the knowledge it needs to answer domain questions accurately - product documentation, policy details, process guides - rather than generating plausible-sounding answers from general training data.

The failure mode is context leakage in the other direction: an assistant that retains context from one user and applies it to another. Ensure session isolation is enforced at the infrastructure level.

## Escalation Paths

Every AI assistant will encounter requests it cannot handle. The design question is not whether escalation will happen - it will - but whether it happens gracefully.

**Define the escalation triggers** - What specifically should cause escalation? Common triggers: request type the assistant cannot handle, user expressing frustration (detected or explicit), a defined number of failed resolution attempts, any request involving money above a threshold, explicit request for a human.

**Warm handoff** - When escalating, pass the conversation context to the human agent. The user should not have to re-explain their situation. The human agent should receive a summary of what was asked, what was tried, and why escalation was triggered.

**Escalation acknowledgment** - Tell the user explicitly when they are being transferred, to whom, and approximately how long they will wait. Disappearing into a queue without acknowledgment is one of the most frustrating assistant experiences.

## Feedback Loops

An assistant without feedback loops cannot improve after deployment.

**Explicit feedback** - Give users a mechanism to indicate when a response was helpful or unhelpful. This does not need to be elaborate - a thumbs up/down after each response is sufficient to generate signal.

**Implicit feedback** - Track behavioral signals: did the user ask a follow-up question that suggests the first answer was incomplete? Did they immediately escalate to a human after the assistant responded? Did they rephrase and re-ask the same question?

**Review cadence** - Assign someone to review feedback signals weekly, at minimum. Identify the top 5-10 failure patterns. Address them in the next iteration. An assistant that is not regularly reviewed against real usage will drift away from user needs.

**Negative space** - What did users ask that the assistant could not handle? These are your feature gaps. Track unanswerable requests as carefully as you track successful ones.

## What to Avoid

Build one thing well rather than ten things poorly. An assistant that handles a specific, high-volume use case reliably is more valuable than one that covers everything superficially. Start with the highest-volume, most-defined use case, instrument it thoroughly, and expand only after that foundation is working.
