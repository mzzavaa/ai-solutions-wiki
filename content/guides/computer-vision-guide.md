Computer vision enables machines to extract meaningful information from images and video. Enterprise applications range from document processing and quality inspection to security monitoring and inventory management. This guide covers practical implementation of computer vision systems.

## Common Enterprise Use Cases

### Document Processing

**Invoice and receipt extraction.** Extract amounts, dates, vendor names, and line items from invoices and receipts. Services like Amazon Textract and Azure Document Intelligence handle this well out of the box.

**Form processing.** Extract data from structured and semi-structured forms. Works best when forms have consistent layouts. Custom models may be needed for unusual form types.

**ID verification.** Extract information from identity documents (passports, driver's licenses) and verify authenticity. Specialized models handle the variety of document formats across countries.

### Quality Inspection

**Manufacturing defect detection.** Identify defects in products on assembly lines: scratches, dents, misalignment, missing components. Requires custom models trained on examples of defective and non-defective products.

**Infrastructure inspection.** Analyze images from drones or cameras to identify damage to buildings, bridges, power lines, or pipelines. Reduces manual inspection effort and improves safety.

### Retail and Inventory

**Shelf monitoring.** Detect out-of-stock products, misplaced items, and pricing errors from shelf images. Requires training on specific store layouts and product catalogs.

**People counting.** Count customers in stores for capacity management and traffic analysis. Pre-trained models work well for this use case.

### Security and Safety

**Anomaly detection.** Identify unusual activities in security camera feeds. Person in restricted area, unattended baggage, safety equipment not worn.

**PPE compliance.** Verify that workers are wearing required personal protective equipment (helmets, vests, goggles) in industrial settings.

## Model Selection

### Pre-Trained Cloud Services

Use cloud AI services for common tasks that do not require custom training:

**Amazon Rekognition.** Object detection, face analysis, text detection, content moderation. Pay-per-image pricing. Good for prototyping and moderate-volume applications.

**Azure AI Vision.** Similar capabilities to Rekognition with additional spatial analysis features. Strong OCR capabilities.

**Google Cloud Vision.** Object detection, OCR, landmark detection. Strong product search capabilities.

**When to use:** The task matches a pre-built capability, custom training data is not available, or you need to ship quickly.

### Pre-Trained Open Source Models

**YOLO (You Only Look Once).** Fast object detection. YOLOv8 and newer versions are suitable for real-time detection. Can be fine-tuned on custom datasets.

**Segment Anything (SAM).** General-purpose image segmentation. Can segment any object in an image with prompts. Useful for interactive annotation and segmentation tasks.

**CLIP.** Multi-modal model that connects images and text. Useful for zero-shot image classification (classify images using text descriptions without training data) and image search.

**When to use:** You need customization, want to avoid cloud service costs at scale, or have privacy requirements.

### Custom Models

Train custom models when pre-trained options do not meet your needs:

**Transfer learning.** Start with a pre-trained model (ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer) and fine-tune on your data. This requires far less data (hundreds to thousands of images) than training from scratch.

**Fully custom.** Train from scratch when the domain is highly specialized and pre-trained features do not transfer well. Requires large datasets (tens of thousands of images).

## Data Requirements

### Training Data

**Volume.** For transfer learning: 100-1000 images per class for classification, 500-5000 images for object detection. For training from scratch: 10,000+ images.

**Quality.** Images should match production conditions. If the production camera is fixed-position with specific lighting, training images should have similar characteristics.

**Labeling.** Classification requires image-level labels. Object detection requires bounding boxes. Segmentation requires pixel-level masks. Labeling cost increases with annotation complexity.

**Diversity.** Include variation in lighting, angle, distance, background, and object appearance. A model trained on perfect studio photos will fail on noisy production images.

### Labeling Tools and Services

**Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth.** Managed labeling service with human workforce (Amazon Mechanical Turk or private workforce). Built-in labeling UIs for common tasks.

**Label Studio.** Open source labeling tool. Self-hosted. Supports images, text, audio, and video. Good for teams that want control over the labeling process.

**Roboflow.** End-to-end platform for computer vision: labeling, augmentation, training, and deployment. Good for teams wanting a streamlined workflow.

## Data Augmentation

Augmentation artificially increases training data diversity by applying transformations:

**Geometric.** Rotation, flipping, scaling, cropping. Teaches the model invariance to position and orientation.

**Color.** Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue adjustments. Teaches robustness to lighting variation.

**Noise.** Gaussian noise, blur, compression artifacts. Teaches robustness to image quality variation.

**Domain-specific.** For manufacturing: add synthetic defects to non-defective images. For document processing: apply distortions that mimic scanning artifacts.

Augmentation can effectively double or triple the useful size of a training dataset.

## Deployment Considerations

### Edge vs Cloud

**Cloud inference.** Send images to a cloud endpoint for processing. Simplest architecture. Requires network connectivity and has latency (100-500ms per image). Suitable for non-real-time applications.

**Edge inference.** Run the model on a device near the camera (edge server, NVIDIA Jetson, industrial PC). Lower latency (10-50ms), no network dependency. Requires model optimization for edge hardware.

**Hybrid.** Simple detection on edge, complex analysis in cloud. Edge detects objects of interest and sends cropped images to cloud for detailed analysis.

### Model Optimization

For deployment, especially on edge devices:

**Quantization.** Reduce model precision from FP32 to INT8. Reduces model size by 4x and improves inference speed with minimal accuracy loss.

**Pruning.** Remove unnecessary model parameters. Reduces model size and speeds up inference.

**Knowledge distillation.** Train a smaller model to mimic a larger model's behavior. Smaller model is faster and cheaper to run.

### Pipeline Design

A production computer vision pipeline:
1. Image capture (camera, upload, API)
2. Preprocessing (resize, normalize, format conversion)
3. Inference (model prediction)
4. Post-processing (threshold, non-max suppression, business logic)
5. Output (alerts, database update, API response)
6. Logging (store inputs, outputs, and metadata for monitoring)

Computer vision projects succeed when the data matches production conditions, the model is evaluated on realistic test data, and the deployment architecture meets latency and reliability requirements. Start with pre-trained services for quick validation, then invest in custom models if the pre-trained options do not meet quality targets.
