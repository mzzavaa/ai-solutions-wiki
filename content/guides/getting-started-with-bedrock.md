Amazon Bedrock is AWS's fully managed service for accessing large language models and foundation models through a single API. For enterprise teams, it offers a compelling alternative to managing model infrastructure directly: you pay per token consumed, your data stays within your AWS account, and model access is governed through IAM just like any other AWS resource.

## What Bedrock Is (and Is Not)

Bedrock is a model access layer, not a model. You do not run a server - you call an API. AWS handles infrastructure, scaling, and model updates. This makes it well-suited for enterprise environments where operational overhead matters.

What Bedrock is not: a replacement for fine-tuning workflows (though it supports some), a vector database (you integrate it with one), or an autonomous agent runtime out of the box (it provides building blocks, not a complete framework).

## Available Foundation Models

Bedrock provides access to models from multiple providers through a unified API:

- **Anthropic Claude** (Claude 3.5, Claude 3 Haiku/Sonnet/Opus) - strongest general reasoning, code, and document analysis
- **Meta Llama** (Llama 3.1, Llama 3.2) - open-weights models, useful where cost matters and quality requirements are moderate
- **Amazon Titan** - Amazon's own models, well-integrated with other AWS services, good for embeddings
- **Mistral AI** - strong European compliance story, competitive performance for document tasks
- **Cohere** - specialized embedding and re-ranking models, useful in RAG pipelines

Model availability varies by AWS region. For EU data residency requirements, check which models are available in `eu-west-1` or `eu-central-1` before committing to an architecture.

## Key Use Cases

**Document analysis** - Bedrock with Claude handles unstructured document processing well: extracting key fields from contracts, summarizing meeting transcripts, classifying incoming correspondence. Combine with Amazon Textract for scanned documents.

**Chatbots and virtual assistants** - Bedrock Agents provides a managed framework for building conversational AI with tool-use capabilities. You define actions (API calls, database queries) and Bedrock handles the reasoning loop.

**Content generation** - Draft generation, translation, reformatting. Particularly effective for internal tools where output quality requirements allow for human review.

**Code assistance** - Bedrock models perform well on code generation and review tasks. For developer tooling, this is one of the fastest paths to measurable productivity gains.

## Getting Started: First Steps

1. **Enable Bedrock in your AWS account** - Navigate to the Bedrock console and request access to the models you need. Access for most models is granted within minutes, though some require additional business verification.

2. **Set up IAM permissions** - Create an IAM role with `bedrock:InvokeModel` permission. For production, scope this to specific model ARNs.

3. **Test with the console playground** - Before writing code, use the Bedrock console's chat interface to experiment with prompts for your use case. This is the fastest way to calibrate expectations.

4. **Integrate via SDK** - Use the AWS SDK (boto3 for Python, or the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK). The `InvokeModel` API takes a JSON body specific to each model provider; the `Converse` API provides a unified interface across providers.

5. **Add guardrails** - For production use, configure Bedrock Guardrails to filter harmful content, enforce topic restrictions, and detect sensitive data patterns in inputs and outputs.

## Pricing Model

Bedrock pricing is per-token (input and output tokens priced separately) with no minimum commitment. Prices vary by model - Claude 3 Haiku is roughly 10x cheaper than Claude 3.5 Sonnet, making model selection an important cost lever. For high-volume workloads, Provisioned Throughput provides reserved capacity at a fixed hourly rate, which becomes cost-effective at sustained load above roughly 40-50 API calls per minute.

There is no charge for API calls that return an error, and no charge for the model access request process itself.
