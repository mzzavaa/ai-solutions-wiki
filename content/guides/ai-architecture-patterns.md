AI systems follow a recognizable architectural evolution as they mature, scale, and take on more complex tasks. Understanding this progression helps teams make deliberate architecture decisions rather than inheriting complexity they did not choose. This article traces the three main stages: monolithic, microservices, and multi-agent, with the signals that indicate when to move between them.

## Stage 1: Monolithic AI

A monolithic AI system routes all requests through a single model endpoint. The application code calls one model, passes a prompt, and receives a response. All logic - retrieval, generation, post-processing - runs in the same call or the same application process.

```
User Request -> Application -> [Single Model Endpoint] -> Response
```

**When this is appropriate:**

- Single well-defined use case (document summarization, classification, Q&A on a fixed corpus)
- Low request volume with no concurrency requirements
- Team is validating whether AI adds value before investing in infrastructure
- Proof of concept or early prototype

**Strengths:** Simple to build, deploy, debug, and reason about. Minimal infrastructure. One moving part.

**Limitations that drive migration:**

- The prompt grows unwieldy as the model must handle multiple task types in a single call
- Latency for complex tasks is too high because sequential operations cannot parallelize
- A failure in any part of the logic fails the entire request
- Scaling one capability requires scaling everything
- Different tasks would benefit from different models (a small fast model for classification, a large model for generation)

**AWS implementation:** A single Amazon Bedrock InvokeModel call wrapped in a Lambda function or API Gateway handler.

## Stage 2: AI Microservices

The microservices stage decomposes the monolith into specialized services, each responsible for a discrete function. The three canonical services in an AI microservices architecture are:

**Ingestion service** - Handles document loading, parsing, chunking, and embedding. Runs on an async queue so it does not block user-facing requests. Writes to the vector store.

**Inference service** - Handles the RAG retrieval and model invocation. Receives a query, retrieves context from the vector store, calls the model, returns the response. This is the latency-sensitive path.

**Output service** - Handles post-processing: formatting, filtering, source attribution, response logging, and routing to downstream systems.

```
Ingestion Queue -> [Ingestion Service] -> Vector Store
                                              |
User Request -> [Inference Service] <---------+
                       |
                [Output Service] -> Response + Logs
```

**When to move from monolith to microservices:**

- Document ingestion is slowing down query responses (separate it onto a queue)
- You need to add a second AI use case with different latency, model, or scaling requirements
- You need independent deployability (update the output formatter without redeploying the retrieval logic)
- Different components have different cost profiles that justify separate scaling

**AWS implementation:**

- Ingestion: S3 event -> SQS -> Lambda -> Bedrock Embeddings -> OpenSearch
- Inference: API Gateway -> Lambda -> Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- Output: Lambda -> DynamoDB (response logging) -> SNS (downstream routing)
- Orchestration: AWS Step Functions for multi-step workflows

Reference: AWS Well-Architected Machine Learning Lens recommends separating data preparation, training/inference, and model serving into distinct components with separate scaling and deployment pipelines.

## Stage 3: Multi-Agent

A multi-agent architecture replaces the monolithic inference service with a system of specialized agents that collaborate to complete tasks. Each agent has a defined role, specific tools or data access, and the ability to pass work to other agents.

```
User Request
     |
[Orchestrator Agent]
     |         |
[Research  [Analysis    [Writer
 Agent]     Agent]       Agent]
     |         |            |
  Web/DB   Calculations  Draft
  Search      |            |
              +------------+
                    |
              [Review Agent]
                    |
               Final Response
```

**Architectural patterns at this stage:**

**Orchestrator-worker** - The most common pattern. A central agent decomposes the task and delegates. Workers report back; the orchestrator synthesizes.

**Pipeline** - Agents arranged in a fixed sequence. Output of each becomes input to the next. Good for linear workflows (classify -> extract -> validate -> route).

**Hierarchical** - Multiple levels of orchestration. A top-level orchestrator delegates to sub-orchestrators who manage clusters of workers. Used for very large task spaces.

**Parallel fan-out** - The orchestrator dispatches the same task to multiple agents simultaneously, then synthesizes results (or selects the best). Used for validation and consensus tasks.

**When to move from microservices to multi-agent:**

- Tasks exceed the context window of a single model call
- Different subtasks require genuinely different capabilities or model sizes
- Subtasks can run in parallel and sequential execution is a bottleneck
- Quality requires independent validation (a second agent reviews the first agent's output)
- The workflow is highly conditional - what to do next depends on intermediate results

**AWS implementation:**

- Amazon Bedrock multi-agent collaboration for orchestrator-worker patterns
- AWS Step Functions for workflow orchestration with explicit state management
- Amazon Bedrock AgentCore for managed agent runtime with memory and session management
- Amazon EventBridge for event-driven agent triggering

## Trade-offs Summary

| Dimension | Monolith | Microservices | Multi-Agent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Debugging | Easy | Medium | Hard |
| Latency | Fixed | Optimizable | Variable |
| Scalability | Limited | Good | High |
| Cost control | Simple | Granular | Complex |
| Task flexibility | Low | Medium | High |
| Team size needed | 1-2 | 2-4 | 4+ |

## Principles Across All Stages

These principles apply regardless of stage, drawn from the AWS Well-Architected Machine Learning Lens:

**Separate data from compute** - Model artifacts, embeddings, and training data live in durable storage (S3, OpenSearch) independent of compute resources. This enables independent scaling and versioning.

**Make outputs observable** - Log every model call: input, output, latency, cost, model version. At monolith scale this is a single log stream. At multi-agent scale it is a distributed trace with a shared trace ID across all agents.

**Design for model version changes** - Models are updated and deprecated. Architecture that hard-codes a specific model version into application logic requires redeployment to update. Route through a model registry or configuration layer.

**Human-in-the-loop for consequential actions** - Regardless of stage, any agent action that cannot be easily reversed (sending an email, modifying a database record, making a financial transaction) should have a human approval checkpoint in production.

**Fail gracefully** - Agents and services fail. Design fallback paths: if the AI component fails, the workflow should either retry with exponential backoff, route to a human, or return a safe degraded response - not crash.
