Hiring AI engineers is one of the most competitive hiring challenges in technology. Demand far exceeds supply, compensation expectations are high, and the skills needed vary dramatically depending on the role. Organizations that hire well share a common trait: they have a clear understanding of what they actually need, not what they think they need.

## Define What You Actually Need

The biggest hiring mistake is posting a generic "AI/ML Engineer" role that lists every possible skill. Start by identifying the actual work:

**If you need someone to build data pipelines, clean data, and manage feature stores** - you need a Data Engineer with ML awareness, not an ML Engineer.

**If you need someone to train, evaluate, and deploy models** - you need an ML Engineer with strong software engineering skills.

**If you need someone to explore data and build prototype models** - you need a Data Scientist. But be honest about whether you need exploration or production capability.

**If you need someone to manage model deployment infrastructure** - you need an MLOps Engineer with DevOps and infrastructure skills.

**If you need someone to research novel approaches to unsolved problems** - you need a Research Scientist. This is rare in enterprise settings.

Each of these roles requires different skills, experience, and compensation. Conflating them into a single job posting attracts candidates who partially match but fully satisfy none of the requirements.

## Writing the Job Description

**Be specific about the technology stack.** "Experience with PyTorch" is more useful than "deep learning experience." "Deployed models on SageMaker or similar" is more useful than "cloud experience." Specificity attracts people who match and filters people who do not.

**State the actual work.** Describe the projects the person will work on. "Build a document classification system for insurance claims processing" is more attractive than "work on cutting-edge AI solutions."

**Be honest about the ratio of research to engineering.** If the job is 80% production engineering and 20% model development, say so. Candidates who want pure research will self-select out, which saves everyone time.

**Include compensation range.** In most AI markets, the range is approximately: junior ML engineer $120K-$160K, mid-level $160K-$220K, senior $220K-$320K, staff/principal $300K-$450K+ (US, total compensation including equity). Posting without a range loses candidates who assume it is below their threshold.

**Skip the PhD requirement unless you need research.** For production ML engineering, strong software engineering skills and practical ML experience matter more than academic credentials. Requiring a PhD for a production engineering role eliminates excellent candidates.

## Sourcing Candidates

**Technical communities.** AI-focused Slack groups, Discord servers, Reddit communities (r/MachineLearning, r/MLOps), and Hacker News. Engage authentically before recruiting.

**Conference networks.** NeurIPS, ICML, and PyTorch Conference for research. MLOps Community events and KubeCon for infrastructure. Meet people, learn about their work, and build relationships.

**Open source contributors.** People who contribute to relevant open source projects (Hugging Face, LangChain, scikit-learn, MLflow) demonstrate practical skills and initiative.

**Internal transfers.** Software engineers interested in ML can be retrained. They already know your codebase, your infrastructure, and your domain. Invest in upskilling programs.

**Universities.** Build relationships with ML programs at local universities. Offer internships and co-op positions. The best students are hired before graduation.

## Technical Evaluation

### Portfolio Review

Review the candidate's GitHub, blog posts, Kaggle profile, and published papers. Look for:
- Production code quality (not just notebooks)
- End-to-end projects (data to deployment, not just model training)
- Clear documentation and communication
- Relevant technology stack experience

### Technical Interview

Structure the interview to evaluate practical skills:

**System design (45 minutes).** Give a real-world problem: "Design a system to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time." Evaluate: architectural thinking, trade-off analysis, practical constraints (latency, cost, data volume), and understanding of where ML fits in the larger system.

**Coding (45 minutes).** A practical coding problem related to actual work: implement a data processing pipeline, write an evaluation framework, build an API endpoint for model serving. Evaluate: code quality, testing instincts, ability to work with data.

**ML depth (30 minutes).** Discuss a model they have built. How did they choose the approach? How did they evaluate it? What went wrong and how did they fix it? Evaluate: depth of understanding, practical problem-solving, ability to explain technical concepts.

**Avoid:** Pure algorithm puzzles (reversing linked lists tells you nothing about ML capability), whiteboard math proofs (unless the role is research), and trivia questions ("what is the time complexity of k-means?").

### Take-Home Assignment (Optional)

Provide a realistic dataset and task: "Build a classifier for these support tickets. Provide your code, evaluation results, and a brief writeup of your approach and trade-offs." Give a reasonable time bound (4-6 hours). Pay candidates for their time if possible.

## Common Hiring Mistakes

**Hiring for pedigree, not skills.** A candidate from a prestigious company or university is not automatically better. Evaluate what they actually did and can do.

**Overweighting Kaggle rankings.** Kaggle competitions reward model accuracy optimization. Production AI requires data engineering, system design, monitoring, and collaboration. The skills overlap but are not identical.

**Hiring full-time when contracting would suffice.** If you need a model built once and then maintained, a 3-month contract with a specialist may be more cost-effective than a full-time hire.

**Slow hiring processes.** AI candidates typically receive multiple offers within 2-3 weeks. If your hiring process takes 6 weeks, you will lose top candidates. Aim for initial screen to offer in 2-3 weeks.

**No growth path.** AI engineers want to learn and grow. If the role offers no exposure to new problems, techniques, or technologies, they will leave within 18 months. Define a career ladder and commit to professional development.

The AI talent market rewards employers who are specific about what they need, efficient in their process, competitive in compensation, and honest about the work. Organizations that offer interesting problems, good infrastructure, and supportive teams hire and retain well despite intense competition.
