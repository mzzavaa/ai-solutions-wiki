Document workflows are one of the most tractable automation problems in enterprise operations. The inputs are clearly defined (documents), the desired outputs are structured data and routed files, and the volume justifies automation investment. This guide covers the full pipeline.

## Stage 1 - Intake

Documents arrive from multiple sources: email attachments, web uploads, fax-to-digital conversion, scanner feeds. The intake stage receives documents regardless of channel and creates a consistent processing record for each.

Each document receives: a unique identifier, a timestamp, source channel metadata, original file storage in S3, and an initial status of "received." No processing happens at intake beyond storage. This ensures documents are never lost even if downstream processing fails.

S3 bucket events trigger the classification step for each new document.

## Stage 2 - Classification

Classification identifies what type of document has arrived. Common classification categories in enterprise contexts: invoice, contract, claim form, identification document, medical record, legal filing, correspondence.

A classification model (fine-tuned or few-shot prompted with examples from your document corpus) assigns a document type and confidence score. Documents below the confidence threshold route to a human classification queue. Documents above threshold proceed automatically.

Classification accuracy is the foundation of the pipeline - a misclassified document will be extracted with the wrong schema and fail validation. Invest in classification quality before optimizing extraction.

## Stage 3 - Extraction

Extraction converts document content into structured data. The approach depends on document type:

**Structured forms** - Use Amazon Textract's Analyze Document or query-based extraction. Textract returns field names and values from forms with high accuracy, including tables and checkboxes. Best for standardized formats: tax forms, insurance claim forms, medical billing forms.

**Semi-structured documents** - Use Textract for raw text extraction, then Bedrock for structured data extraction from the text. The Bedrock call receives the raw text and a prompt specifying the target JSON schema. This handles documents like invoices and contracts that follow a pattern but vary in layout.

**Freeform documents** - Use Bedrock directly with the document text and a prompt that extracts the relevant information. Accuracy is lower than for structured forms; build in validation and exception handling.

Every extraction result includes confidence metadata per field. Low-confidence fields are flagged for review.

## Stage 4 - Validation

Validation checks the extracted data for completeness and consistency before it proceeds.

**Completeness checks** - Are all required fields present? A claim form missing the loss date cannot be processed.

**Format validation** - Do extracted values match expected formats? Dates parse as dates. Currency values parse as numbers. Policy numbers match the expected pattern.

**Cross-field consistency** - Do related fields agree? The claim date should not precede the policy effective date.

**Business rule validation** - Domain-specific rules: claim amounts within policy limits, dates within valid ranges, referenced entities exist in the system of record.

Validation failures generate a structured exception record describing what failed. Documents with exceptions route to the correction queue where a human or an automated re-request handles resolution.

## Stage 5 - Routing

Valid documents route to the appropriate downstream system or queue based on document type, extracted content, and business rules.

Routing rules are managed as configuration, not code, so they can be updated without a deployment. A rules engine evaluates the document record against routing conditions and writes the routing decision to the processing record.

Step Functions coordinates the routing step and maintains state - if a downstream system is unavailable, the document waits and retries rather than being lost.

## Stage 6 - Archive

Every document and its associated processing record is archived at completion. The archive includes: original document, all extracted data, all validation results, routing history, and processing timestamps.

Archive storage uses S3 with lifecycle policies: active documents in standard storage, completed documents transition to S3 Infrequent Access after 90 days, then to Glacier after 1 year. Retention periods are configured per document type to match regulatory requirements.

For regulated industries, enable S3 Object Lock with WORM (write once read many) settings on the archive bucket. This prevents modification or deletion of archived documents within the retention period.

## Monitoring

Track at each stage: volume, processing time, error rate, exception rate, and human review rate. Exception rate is the most important metric - rising exceptions indicate problems in extraction or classification quality that compound over time.
