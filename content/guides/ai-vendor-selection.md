The AI vendor landscape is crowded, fast-moving, and full of exaggerated claims. Choosing the wrong vendor means wasted integration effort, vendor lock-in, compliance gaps, or capabilities that do not meet actual needs. A structured evaluation framework reduces these risks and produces defensible procurement decisions.

## Define Requirements First

Before evaluating vendors, document what you actually need:

**Functional requirements.** What tasks must the AI system perform? What accuracy or quality level is acceptable? What input/output formats are required? What languages must be supported?

**Non-functional requirements.** Latency limits, throughput requirements, availability targets, scalability needs, and geographic deployment constraints.

**Data requirements.** Where does your data live? Can it leave your environment? What data residency requirements apply? What sensitivity classifications are involved?

**Compliance requirements.** Which regulations apply (EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2)? What certifications does the vendor need? What audit rights do you require?

**Integration requirements.** What systems must the AI vendor integrate with? What APIs, SDKs, or deployment options are needed? What is the technical skill level of the team that will operate it?

## Evaluation Dimensions

**Technical capability.** Run your own benchmarks on your own data. Vendor-published benchmarks use favorable datasets and may not reflect your use case. Create an evaluation dataset that represents your actual workload and test all shortlisted vendors against it. Compare accuracy, latency, and edge case handling.

**Data handling.** How does the vendor process your data? Is it used for model training? Where is it stored? How long is it retained? What happens to your data if you terminate the contract? Get explicit written answers, not just privacy policy references.

**Security.** What certifications does the vendor hold (SOC 2, ISO 27001)? What encryption is used in transit and at rest? How is access controlled? What is the vulnerability disclosure and patching process? Request recent penetration test summaries.

**Reliability.** What is the vendor's historical uptime? What SLAs are offered? What happens when the SLA is breached? What is the disaster recovery plan? How are incidents communicated?

**Pricing model.** Understand the full cost: per-token, per-request, per-seat, or per-volume pricing, plus any minimum commitments, overage charges, and support tier costs. Model your expected usage patterns and calculate total cost of ownership across a realistic range of scenarios.

**Roadmap and viability.** Is the vendor financially stable? What is their product roadmap? How responsive are they to feature requests? What is their track record of maintaining backward compatibility? A startup with impressive technology but uncertain funding is a different risk profile than an established cloud provider.

**Lock-in risk.** How difficult is it to switch vendors? Are you using proprietary APIs, fine-tuned models, or custom features that would be hard to replicate elsewhere? Prefer vendors that use standard interfaces and allow model or data portability.

## Evaluation Process

**Initial screening.** Reduce a long list to 3-5 candidates based on published capabilities, pricing, and compliance posture. This can be done with vendor documentation and brief demo calls.

**Technical proof of concept.** Run each shortlisted vendor through a structured POC using your evaluation dataset and real integration scenarios. Define success criteria before starting.

**Reference checks.** Speak with existing customers, preferably in your industry and at similar scale. Ask about production reliability, support quality, and any surprises after signing.

**Commercial negotiation.** Negotiate pricing, SLAs, data handling terms, and exit provisions based on POC results and reference feedback.

## Decision Framework

Score each vendor across your evaluation dimensions using a weighted matrix. Weight dimensions based on your priorities. Technical capability and data handling should always be heavily weighted. Present the scored matrix alongside qualitative findings from POCs and references to stakeholders for final decision.

## Post-Selection

Define success metrics and review milestones. Conduct a formal review after 90 days to verify that production performance matches POC results. Maintain a migration plan even after selecting a vendor, because the AI landscape changes rapidly and today's best choice may not be tomorrow's.
