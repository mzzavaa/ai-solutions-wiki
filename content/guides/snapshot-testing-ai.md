Snapshot testing captures a known-good output and compares future outputs against it. When the output changes, the test fails, forcing a developer to review the change and either fix a regression or intentionally update the snapshot. For AI systems, traditional exact-match snapshots are too brittle because model outputs vary. This guide covers snapshot strategies adapted for non-deterministic AI outputs.

## Traditional Snapshots for Deterministic Components

Parts of your AI pipeline are deterministic and suit exact-match snapshots perfectly.

**Prompt template snapshots.** Capture the fully rendered prompt and compare it on every test run. This catches unintentional prompt changes immediately.

```python
def test_system_prompt_snapshot(snapshot):
    prompt = build_system_prompt(
        persona="helpful assistant",
        guardrails=["no medical advice", "no code generation"],
        version="v3"
    )
    snapshot.assert_match(prompt, "system_prompt_v3.txt")
```

When a developer changes the prompt template, the snapshot test fails. They review the diff, confirm the change is intentional, and update the snapshot with `pytest --snapshot-update`.

**Configuration snapshots.** Capture model parameters, pipeline configuration, and feature flags.

```python
def test_pipeline_config_snapshot(snapshot):
    config = pipeline.get_config()
    snapshot.assert_match(json.dumps(config, indent=2), "pipeline_config.json")
```

## Structural Snapshots

Instead of comparing exact content, compare the structure of AI outputs. This is useful when the exact text varies but the shape should be consistent.

```python
def extract_structure(response: dict) -> dict:
    """Extract the structural skeleton of a response, ignoring exact values."""
    def structure_of(value):
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            return {k: structure_of(v) for k, v in value.items()}
        if isinstance(value, list):
            if len(value) == 0:
                return "list(empty)"
            return [structure_of(value[0]), f"...({len(value)} items)"]
        return type(value).__name__
    return structure_of(response)

def test_response_structure_snapshot(snapshot):
    response = pipeline.run("What is Python?")
    structure = extract_structure(response.to_dict())
    snapshot.assert_match(json.dumps(structure, indent=2), "response_structure.json")
```

A structural snapshot might look like:

```json
{
  "answer": "str",
  "confidence": "float",
  "sources": [
    {"id": "str", "text": "str", "score": "float"},
    "...(3 items)"
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "model": "str",
    "latency_ms": "int"
  }
}
```

This catches structural regressions (missing fields, wrong types, changed nesting) without breaking on text variation.

## Semantic Similarity Assertions

Replace exact string comparison with semantic similarity. Two responses that say the same thing in different words should both pass.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

def assert_semantically_similar(actual: str, expected: str, threshold: float = 0.80):
    """Assert that two texts are semantically similar above a threshold."""
    embeddings = model.encode([actual, expected])
    similarity = float(util.cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1]))
    assert similarity >= threshold, (
        f"Semantic similarity {similarity:.3f} below threshold {threshold}. "
        f"Expected: '{expected[:100]}...', Got: '{actual[:100]}...'"
    )

def test_response_semantically_matches_golden():
    golden = "Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum."
    response = pipeline.run("What is Python?")
    assert_semantically_similar(response.answer, golden, threshold=0.75)
```

Semantic similarity assertions tolerate paraphrasing but catch responses that are off-topic or factually wrong. Set the threshold based on empirical testing: too high (0.95) and you get false failures from paraphrasing; too low (0.50) and you miss real regressions.

## Managing Snapshot Updates When Models Change

Model updates change outputs. When you upgrade from one model version to another, many snapshots will break. Manage this with a process.

**Batch update workflow:**

1. Run the full snapshot suite against the new model
2. Review all failures as a batch: are changes improvements, regressions, or neutral variations?
3. Update snapshots for improvements and neutral changes
4. Fix regressions before accepting the model update

**Version your snapshots.** Include the model version in snapshot filenames or directories.

```
tests/snapshots/
  gpt-4o-2024-08-06/
    system_prompt_v3.txt
    response_structure.json
  gpt-4o-2025-01-15/
    system_prompt_v3.txt
    response_structure.json
```

This creates a clear history of how outputs change across model versions.

## LLM-as-Judge for Snapshot Comparison

For complex outputs where semantic similarity is insufficient, use an LLM to judge whether the new output is equivalent to the golden output.

```python
def llm_judge_equivalent(golden: str, actual: str, criteria: str) -> bool:
    """Use an LLM to judge whether actual output is equivalent to golden."""
    prompt = f"""Compare these two responses and determine if they are functionally equivalent.

Golden response: {golden}
Actual response: {actual}
Criteria: {criteria}

Answer with only "EQUIVALENT" or "NOT_EQUIVALENT" followed by a brief reason."""

    result = judge_model.generate(prompt, temperature=0)
    return result.strip().startswith("EQUIVALENT")

def test_response_judged_equivalent():
    golden = load_fixture("golden/python_answer.txt")
    actual = pipeline.run("What is Python?").answer
    assert llm_judge_equivalent(golden, actual, "Factually accurate and complete")
```

This is expensive (it requires a model call per assertion) and should be used sparingly: for critical outputs in a scheduled eval suite, not in every PR test run.

## Tools

**pytest-snapshot** (Python): Integrates snapshot testing with pytest. Simple API: `snapshot.assert_match(value, snapshot_name)`.

**syrupy** (Python): A more full-featured snapshot library with custom serializers and inline snapshots.

**Jest snapshots** (JavaScript): Built into Jest with `expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()`. Supports inline snapshots and custom serializers.

**Custom semantic diff:** Build a thin wrapper that combines structural comparison for JSON shape and semantic similarity for text fields. This gives you the best of both approaches: strict validation of structure, flexible validation of content.

```python
def semantic_snapshot_compare(actual: dict, golden: dict, text_fields: list[str]):
    """Compare structure exactly, text fields semantically."""
    for key, value in golden.items():
        assert key in actual, f"Missing key: {key}"
        if key in text_fields:
            assert_semantically_similar(actual[key], value, threshold=0.75)
        elif isinstance(value, dict):
            semantic_snapshot_compare(actual[key], value, text_fields)
        else:
            assert actual[key] == value, f"Mismatch on {key}: {actual[key]} != {value}"
```
