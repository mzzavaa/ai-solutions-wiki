Ground truth is the verified correct answer for a given input in a machine learning context. It is the label, annotation, or outcome that represents what the model should have predicted. Ground truth serves as the standard against which model predictions are evaluated during training, validation, and production monitoring.

## Why Ground Truth Matters

Every supervised ML evaluation depends on ground truth. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and AUC are all computed by comparing model predictions against ground truth labels. If the ground truth is wrong, the evaluation is wrong, and decisions based on that evaluation are unreliable. A model that appears to have 95% accuracy on incorrectly labeled data may perform far worse in reality.

Ground truth quality sets the ceiling for model performance. A model trained on noisy labels learns noisy patterns. No amount of architectural innovation or hyperparameter tuning can compensate for fundamentally incorrect training labels.

## Sources of Ground Truth

**Human annotation** - Domain experts or trained annotators manually label data. This is the most common source of ground truth for tasks like image classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis. Quality depends on clear annotation guidelines, annotator training, and inter-annotator agreement measurement.

**Observed outcomes** - For some tasks, ground truth comes from real-world outcomes that are eventually observed. A fraud detection model's ground truth is whether a transaction was actually fraudulent, determined by investigation. A churn prediction model's ground truth is whether the customer actually churned.

**Programmatic labeling** - Heuristic rules, regular expressions, or existing systems generate labels at scale. These labels are noisier than human annotation but can be produced cheaply in large volumes. Weak supervision frameworks like Snorkel combine multiple noisy labeling functions to produce higher-quality aggregate labels.

**Synthetic generation** - Ground truth is created by generating synthetic data where the correct label is known by construction. Useful for augmenting training data but must be validated against real-world distributions.

## Challenges

Ground truth is often delayed, expensive, or ambiguous. In fraud detection, investigations may take weeks to determine whether a transaction was truly fraudulent. In medical imaging, expert radiologists may disagree on the correct diagnosis. In subjective tasks like content moderation, there may be no single correct answer.

Organizations must invest in ground truth infrastructure: annotation platforms, quality assurance processes, and feedback loops that capture real-world outcomes and feed them back into the evaluation pipeline. Treating ground truth as an afterthought undermines every downstream ML decision.
