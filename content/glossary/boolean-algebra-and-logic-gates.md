Boolean algebra is a branch of algebra that operates on binary values (true/false, 1/0) using logical operations (AND, OR, NOT). Logic gates are physical or electronic implementations of Boolean functions that form the building blocks of all digital circuits and computer hardware.

## Origins and History

George Boole, an English mathematician, published *An Investigation of the Laws of Thought* in 1854, establishing an algebraic system for logical reasoning using binary variables and logical operators. Boole's work remained primarily a mathematical curiosity for decades. The pivotal connection between Boolean algebra and electrical circuits was made by Claude Shannon in his 1937 master's thesis at MIT, "A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits," which demonstrated that Boolean algebra could be used to design and simplify electrical switching circuits. Shannon showed that any Boolean function could be implemented using combinations of switches (relays), laying the theoretical foundation for digital circuit design. This insight is regarded as one of the most important master's theses of the 20th century. The development of the transistor at Bell Labs (1947) by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley made it practical to build logic gates as compact electronic components, leading to integrated circuits and modern processors.

## Core Concepts

The three fundamental Boolean operations are **AND** (output is 1 only when all inputs are 1), **OR** (output is 1 when at least one input is 1), and **NOT** (inverts the input). From these, all other operations can be derived: **NAND** (NOT-AND), **NOR** (NOT-OR), **XOR** (exclusive OR, output is 1 when inputs differ), and **XNOR** (output is 1 when inputs are the same). NAND and NOR are each independently **functionally complete** -- any Boolean function can be built using only NAND gates or only NOR gates. Boolean identities (De Morgan's laws, distributive law, absorption law) are used to simplify expressions and minimize circuit complexity.

## Practical Applications

Logic gates are the physical foundation of all digital hardware: processors, memory, controllers, and communication interfaces. Boolean algebra is used in digital circuit design, database query optimization (WHERE clauses), search engine logic, programming conditional expressions, and formal verification of hardware and software systems.
