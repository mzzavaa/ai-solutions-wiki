XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a gradient-boosted decision tree framework that is the most widely used model for structured/tabular data tasks. It builds an ensemble of decision trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ensemble. XGBoost adds regularization, efficient computation, and handling of missing values to the standard gradient boosting algorithm.

## How It Works

Gradient boosting trains trees sequentially. The first tree fits the target variable. The second tree fits the residual errors of the first tree. The third tree fits the remaining residuals, and so on. Each tree is a small, shallow tree (weak learner) that captures a portion of the remaining pattern. The final prediction is the sum of all trees' predictions.

XGBoost adds several enhancements: L1 and L2 regularization on leaf weights to prevent overfitting, built-in handling of missing values (the algorithm learns the optimal direction for missing values at each split), column subsampling (similar to random forests), and highly optimized parallel tree construction.

## Why It Dominates

XGBoost and its relatives (LightGBM, CatBoost) consistently win machine learning competitions on structured data and outperform deep learning for most tabular data tasks. The reasons: tree-based models naturally handle feature interactions, mixed data types (numeric and categorical), and non-linear relationships without manual feature engineering. They train in minutes on datasets where neural networks take hours.

## Practical Guidance

**Start here for structured data** - for any prediction task on tabular data (churn, fraud, pricing, demand), XGBoost should be your first model. It frequently delivers production-ready accuracy with modest effort.

**Key hyperparameters** - learning rate (0.01-0.1), max depth (3-8), number of trees (100-1000), and min child weight are the most impactful. Use early stopping on a validation set to determine the optimal number of trees.

**Feature importance** - XGBoost provides feature importance rankings that support data quality investigation and feature engineering priorities.

**Deployment** - trained XGBoost models are lightweight (megabytes, not gigabytes) and produce predictions in milliseconds. They deploy easily on Lambda, containers, or SageMaker endpoints without GPU requirements.

## Alternatives

**LightGBM** trains faster on large datasets due to histogram-based splitting. Often comparable accuracy with better training speed. **CatBoost** handles categorical features natively without encoding and may outperform on datasets with many categorical columns.
