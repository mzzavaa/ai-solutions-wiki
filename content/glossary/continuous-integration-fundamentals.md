Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where team members integrate their work frequently -- ideally multiple times per day -- with each integration verified by an automated build and automated tests. The goal is to detect integration problems early, when they are small and easy to fix.

## Origins and History

The term "continuous integration" was coined by Grady Booch in his 1991 book *Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications*, where he described it as a practice of integrating frequently to avoid integration problems. Kent Beck made CI a core practice of Extreme Programming (XP) in 1999, defining the specific discipline of committing to trunk at least daily with automated builds and tests. Martin Fowler's influential 2006 article "Continuous Integration" codified the practice with detailed guidance. CruiseControl, developed by ThoughtWorks (2001), was one of the first dedicated CI servers. Jenkins (originally Hudson, 2004) became the dominant open-source CI tool. The practice evolved into Continuous Delivery (Jez Humble and David Farley, 2010) and Continuous Deployment, extending automation through the entire release pipeline. Modern CI/CD platforms include GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, and AWS CodePipeline.

## Core Practices

**Maintain a single source repository** where all code lives and is the definitive source of truth. **Automate the build** so that the entire system can be built from a single command. **Make the build self-testing** by including automated tests (unit, integration) that run as part of every build. **Everyone commits to the mainline frequently**, at least daily, to minimize divergence. **Every commit triggers a build** on the CI server, providing rapid feedback. **Fix broken builds immediately** -- a failing build is the team's highest priority. **Keep the build fast** (ideally under 10 minutes) to maintain the feedback loop.

## Practical Applications

CI reduces integration risk, catches bugs early when they are cheapest to fix, provides constant visibility into project health through build dashboards, and enables practices like feature flags and trunk-based development. It is a prerequisite for continuous delivery and deployment pipelines.
