Cloud governance is the set of policies, processes, organizational structures, and technical controls that an organization implements to manage its use of cloud computing services. It ensures that cloud resources are used securely, cost-effectively, and in compliance with regulatory requirements while supporting business objectives.

## Core Pillars

Cloud governance typically covers five areas. **Security governance** defines access controls, encryption requirements, network policies, and incident response procedures for cloud environments. **Cost governance** establishes budgets, tagging policies, resource lifecycle rules, and optimization practices to prevent cloud spend from growing unchecked. **Compliance governance** ensures cloud usage meets regulatory requirements such as GDPR, NIS2, and industry-specific standards. **Operational governance** defines standards for provisioning, monitoring, patching, and decommissioning cloud resources. **Data governance** establishes policies for data classification, retention, sovereignty, and access across cloud services.

## Why It Matters for AI

AI workloads amplify cloud governance challenges. GPU instances for training are expensive and easy to leave running. Training data may be subject to sovereignty requirements that constrain which regions can be used. Model artifacts need versioning and access control. Inference endpoints must be monitored for security and performance. Without governance, AI teams can rapidly accumulate costs, create security exposures, and violate compliance requirements.

## Implementation Mechanisms

Cloud providers offer native governance tools: AWS Organizations with Service Control Policies, Azure Policy and Management Groups, and GCP Organization Policies. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CDK) enforces consistent configuration. Policy-as-code tools (OPA, Sentinel) automate compliance checking. Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) tools continuously assess the security state of cloud environments.

## Organizational Model

Effective cloud governance requires clear ownership. A Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE) or platform engineering team typically defines governance policies, while development teams implement them. Guardrails should be automated wherever possible to reduce friction and prevent policy violations before they reach production.
