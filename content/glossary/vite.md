Vite (French for "fast," pronounced /vit/) is a frontend build tool that provides a dramatically faster development experience by serving source code over native ES modules during development and using Rollup for optimized production builds. Created by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, Vite replaced Webpack as the preferred dev server for a growing number of frameworks.

## Origins and History

By 2020, Webpack had been the dominant JavaScript bundler for years, but developer experience had degraded as applications grew larger. Cold-starting a Webpack dev server on a large project could take tens of seconds, and hot module replacement (HMR) slowed proportionally with application size because the entire module graph had to be re-analyzed on each change.

Evan You had been experimenting with a prototype called Vue Dev Server as early as 2019, exploring whether native ES module imports in modern browsers could eliminate the need for bundling during development. On the night of April 19, 2020, the approach crystallized --- as You later described it, "it just clicked how to do hot module replacement over native ESM" [1]. He coded through the night and announced Vite publicly on the morning of April 20, 2020, via a tweet that quickly spread through the JavaScript community [2].

The initial prototype was Vue-specific, but community feedback pushed You to redesign Vite as a framework-agnostic tool by mid-2020. Vite 2.0, released on February 16, 2021, formalized this direction with a plugin API based on Rollup's plugin interface, enabling first-class support for React, Svelte, Preact, and other frameworks [3].

## How It Works

**Native ES modules in development.** Modern browsers support `import` and `export` natively. Vite serves each module as an individual file via the browser's native module system. When you start the dev server, Vite does not bundle your application. Instead, it transforms and serves modules on demand as the browser requests them. This means dev server startup time is essentially constant regardless of application size.

**Dependency pre-bundling.** Third-party dependencies (from `node_modules`) are pre-bundled using esbuild, a Go-based bundler that is 10-100x faster than JavaScript-based alternatives. This step converts CommonJS and UMD modules to ESM and collapses deep import chains into single modules to avoid excessive HTTP requests.

**Hot module replacement (HMR).** When a file changes, Vite determines the precise module boundary affected and pushes only that module to the browser over WebSocket. Because only the changed module is replaced (not the entire dependency graph), HMR remains fast regardless of project size.

**Production builds with Rollup.** For production, Vite uses Rollup to produce optimized, tree-shaken bundles with code splitting. The development and production pipelines are separate --- native ESM for speed during development, full bundling for optimization in production.

## Why It Replaced Webpack for Development

The fundamental architectural difference is that Webpack bundles first and serves second, while Vite serves first and bundles only what the browser requests. In a large application with thousands of modules, Webpack must process the entire module graph before the first page load. Vite processes only the modules actually imported by the page being viewed, deferring everything else.

This architecture shift produced measurable results: dev server cold start times dropped from 30+ seconds to under one second on large codebases, and HMR updates propagated in milliseconds rather than seconds.

## Ecosystem Adoption

By 2024, Vite had surpassed 13 million weekly npm downloads. Major frameworks adopted Vite as their default build tool, including Angular, Astro, Nuxt, Remix, SolidStart, SvelteKit, and Qwik. Evan You founded VoidZero in 2024 to build a unified JavaScript toolchain around Vite, with Rolldown (a Rust-based Rollup replacement) as the next-generation bundler.
