A graph neural network (GNN) is a deep learning architecture designed to operate on graph-structured data, where entities (nodes) are connected by relationships (edges). Unlike CNNs and RNNs that assume grid or sequential structure, GNNs learn representations by aggregating information from a node's neighbors, making them suitable for social networks, molecular structures, recommendation systems, and knowledge graphs.

## How It Works

GNNs operate through message passing: each node collects feature vectors from its neighbors, aggregates them (via sum, mean, or attention), and updates its own representation. Stacking multiple layers allows information to propagate across multi-hop neighborhoods.

**Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)** apply a simplified spectral convolution, averaging neighbor features with learned weights. **Graph Attention Networks (GAT)** introduce attention mechanisms so each node learns which neighbors are most relevant, similar to how transformers weigh tokens. **GraphSAGE** samples a fixed number of neighbors and learns an aggregation function, enabling inductive learning on unseen nodes without retraining the entire graph.

GNNs support three levels of tasks: **node-level** (classifying users in a fraud network), **edge-level** (predicting missing links in a knowledge graph), and **graph-level** (predicting molecular properties from atomic structure).

## Why It Matters

Many real-world datasets are naturally graph-structured. Social networks, supply chains, communication networks, and biological systems all contain relational information that tabular or sequential models discard. GNNs capture this structure directly, enabling applications like fraud detection, drug discovery, traffic prediction, and recommendation engines that outperform non-graph alternatives.

## Practical Considerations

Graph data requires specialized infrastructure. Libraries like PyTorch Geometric and DGL handle sparse adjacency matrices and mini-batch sampling. Scalability is the primary challenge: real-world graphs with billions of edges require distributed training and neighbor sampling strategies. For teams evaluating GNNs, start with a well-defined graph structure and a clear task. If the relational structure does not demonstrably improve over tabular baselines, simpler approaches may be more maintainable.
