Routing and switching are the two core operations that move data through networks. Switching operates at Layer 2 (Data Link), forwarding frames based on MAC addresses within a local network segment. Routing operates at Layer 3 (Network), forwarding packets based on IP addresses across different networks. Together, they form the packet delivery infrastructure of all modern networks.

## Switching

A network switch connects devices on the same local area network (LAN). When a device sends a frame, the switch reads the destination MAC address and forwards the frame only to the port where that device is connected, rather than flooding it to all ports.

**MAC address learning** happens automatically. The switch maintains a MAC address table (also called a CAM table) that maps MAC addresses to physical ports. When a frame arrives, the switch records the source MAC address and the port it arrived on. Over time, the table is populated with all connected devices.

**VLANs (Virtual LANs)** logically segment a physical switch into multiple broadcast domains. Devices on different VLANs cannot communicate without a router, even if they share the same physical switch. VLANs improve security and reduce broadcast traffic.

**Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)** prevents loops in networks with redundant switch connections. Without STP, frames could circulate indefinitely. STP selects a root bridge and disables redundant paths, activating them only if the primary path fails.

## Routing

A router connects different networks and forwards packets based on their destination IP address. The router consults its routing table to determine the best next hop for each packet.

**Static routes** are manually configured by administrators. They are simple and predictable but do not adapt to network changes.

**Dynamic routing protocols** allow routers to discover paths automatically and adapt to topology changes. Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) route within an autonomous system: OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) uses link-state information to calculate shortest paths, while EIGRP uses a distance-vector approach. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routes between autonomous systems and is the protocol that holds the Internet together.

**Routing decisions** consider metrics such as hop count, bandwidth, latency, and administrative cost. When multiple paths exist, the router selects the path with the best metric.

## Layer 3 Switching

Modern enterprise networks use Layer 3 switches that combine switching and routing in a single device. They forward traffic at wire speed using hardware-based routing tables (ASICs), handling inter-VLAN routing without a separate router.

## Origins and History

Ethernet switching evolved from early hubs and bridges. Kalpana introduced the first commercial Ethernet switch in 1990 [1]. Routing protocols emerged alongside the ARPANET: the first routing protocol was the Routing Information Protocol (RIP), based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm, used in the ARPANET in the early 1980s [2]. OSPF was standardized in RFC 1247 (1991) [3], and BGP-4 in RFC 1771 (1995) [4].
