The transformer is a neural network architecture introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It processes input sequences entirely through attention mechanisms, without recurrence or convolution. Virtually all modern large language models (GPT, Claude, Llama, Gemini) are built on transformer variants.

## How It Works

A transformer consists of an encoder (processes input) and a decoder (produces output), though many modern models use only one half. Each layer contains two sub-components: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward neural network. Layer normalization and residual connections stabilize training.

The input sequence is first converted to embeddings, then augmented with positional encodings (since attention has no inherent sense of order). These representations pass through multiple transformer layers, each refining the representation by attending to relevant context.

**Encoder-only models** (BERT) process the full input bidirectionally and are used for classification, extraction, and embedding tasks. **Decoder-only models** (GPT, Claude) process tokens left-to-right and are used for text generation. **Encoder-decoder models** (T5, original transformer) are used for translation and summarization.

## Why It Matters

The transformer's key advantage is parallelism. Unlike RNNs that process tokens sequentially, transformers process all positions simultaneously during training. This enables training on massive datasets using GPU clusters, which directly led to the scaling of foundation models.

For technical decision-makers, the transformer architecture determines the cost and capability profile of AI systems. Context window length, inference latency, and memory requirements all derive from transformer design choices. Understanding these tradeoffs informs decisions about model selection, infrastructure sizing, and cost management.

## Practical Considerations

Transformer inference cost scales with sequence length. Longer context windows require more memory and compute. Techniques like KV-cache optimization, quantization, and sparse attention are engineering responses to these constraints. When evaluating AI platforms, understanding that longer contexts cost more - both in latency and dollars - helps set realistic expectations for production workloads.
