AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) applies machine learning and analytics to operational data - logs, metrics, traces, and events - to improve monitoring, reduce alert fatigue, accelerate root cause analysis, and automate remediation. The term was coined by Gartner in 2017 but the practices have matured significantly since.

The core problem AIOps addresses: modern distributed systems generate too much operational data for humans to process manually. A single Kubernetes cluster running AI inference services can produce thousands of metrics per second. Traditional threshold-based alerting creates alert storms during incidents, burying the signal in noise.

## Core Capabilities

**Anomaly Detection** - Machine learning models learn normal behaviour patterns for metrics (latency, error rate, throughput, GPU utilisation) and alert only when behaviour deviates significantly. This replaces static thresholds that either fire too often or miss gradual degradation.

**Alert Correlation and Deduplication** - When a database slowdown causes cascading failures across ten services, AIOps correlates the resulting alerts into a single incident rather than paging the on-call engineer ten times. Tools like PagerDuty, BigPanda, and Moogsoft perform this correlation.

**Root Cause Analysis** - Given a set of correlated symptoms, AIOps tools trace the dependency graph to identify the probable root cause. If inference latency spikes correlate with a GPU memory metric change on a specific node, the system surfaces that node as the likely culprit.

**Automated Remediation** - For well-understood failure modes, AIOps can trigger automated fixes: restarting a pod, scaling up replicas, failing over to a healthy region, or rolling back a deployment. This reduces mean time to recovery (MTTR) from minutes to seconds.

**Noise Reduction** - By learning which alerts lead to human action and which are consistently ignored, AIOps systems suppress low-value alerts and prioritise actionable ones. This directly reduces on-call burnout.

## AIOps for AI Systems

AI systems present unique operational challenges. Model performance degrades due to data drift, not just infrastructure failures. GPU memory leaks accumulate over days. Token generation latency varies with prompt length. AIOps tools monitoring AI workloads need to understand these domain-specific patterns.

The irony of using AI to monitor AI is not lost on practitioners - but it works. The operational patterns are different enough from model behaviour that the monitoring layer adds genuine value.
