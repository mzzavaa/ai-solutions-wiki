An AI knowledge base is a structured or semi-structured collection of documents, data, and information that an AI system can retrieve and use to generate grounded responses. The term overlaps with "traditional" knowledge bases but differs in how content is stored, indexed, and retrieved.

## Traditional vs. AI Knowledge Base

A traditional knowledge base - like a Confluence wiki, a SharePoint site, or a help center - organizes content for human navigation. Articles are categorized, tagged, and linked. Search is keyword-based. The primary interface is a human reading pages.

An AI knowledge base is optimized for retrieval by AI systems rather than human navigation. Key differences:

**Storage format** - Content is chunked into segments (typically 200-1,000 tokens) and stored with both the original text and its vector embedding. The chunking is designed for retrieval quality, not human readability.

**Retrieval mechanism** - AI knowledge bases use semantic (vector) search: given a query, the system finds chunks whose meaning is closest to the query, regardless of exact keyword overlap. A question about "contract termination terms" retrieves relevant chunks even if they use the phrase "agreement end conditions."

**Interface** - The primary interface is a programmatic API or a language model, not a human browsing interface.

## How It Works With RAG

The AI knowledge base is the retrieval component in a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture. When a user asks a question:

1. The query is embedded into a vector
2. The vector store finds the most similar chunks in the knowledge base
3. Those chunks are inserted into the model's context as supporting evidence
4. The model generates an answer grounded in the retrieved content

The quality of the knowledge base - how well documents are chunked, how current the content is, how well the schema captures semantic structure - directly determines the quality of RAG-based AI responses.

## Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases

Amazon Bedrock offers a managed knowledge base service. You point it at an S3 bucket containing documents; Bedrock handles chunking, embedding, and indexing into an OpenSearch or Aurora PostgreSQL vector store. Retrieval is exposed via API for use in agent workflows.

This reduces the engineering effort to build a RAG system significantly - you configure rather than build the ingestion and retrieval infrastructure. Trade-offs include less control over chunking strategy and limited support for custom preprocessing compared to a fully custom implementation.

## When to Use an AI Knowledge Base

Use an AI knowledge base when:
- Your AI assistant needs to answer questions based on specific organizational documents
- The information changes frequently (unlike fine-tuning, knowledge base content can be updated without retraining)
- The information set is too large to include in every prompt
- You need citations - retrieval-based systems can return the source document for each answer

The knowledge base approach is more flexible and more maintainable than fine-tuning for knowledge-intensive use cases. Fine-tuning is better for adapting model behavior and style; knowledge bases are better for keeping the model up to date with facts, policies, and documents.
