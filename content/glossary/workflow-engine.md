A workflow engine is a software system that interprets process definitions and orchestrates the execution of tasks, routing work between human participants and automated systems according to predefined rules and conditions. It serves as the runtime backbone of business process automation.

## Origins and History

Workflow automation has roots in office automation research of the 1970s and 1980s. The first commercial workflow management systems appeared in the early 1990s, with products from FileNET, Staffware, and IBM. The Workflow Management Coalition (WfMC), founded in 1993, published the Workflow Reference Model that defined a standard architecture with five interfaces for interoperability. The early 2000s saw workflow engines embedded within enterprise application integration (EAI) and BPM suites. More recently, lightweight open-source engines such as Camunda (forked from Activiti in 2013), Flowable, and Temporal have shifted the market toward developer-friendly, microservices-compatible workflow orchestration.

## How It Works

A workflow engine operates on a process definition, typically expressed in BPMN, a proprietary DSL, or code. When a process instance is started, the engine creates a runtime representation and advances through the defined steps. At each step, the engine evaluates conditions at gateways, assigns user tasks to work queues or specific participants, invokes service tasks by calling external APIs or message queues, manages timer events and deadlines, and handles error and compensation logic. The engine persists the state of each process instance so that long-running processes (days, weeks, or months) survive system restarts.

## Practical Applications

Workflow engines are used for automating approval chains in procurement and HR, orchestrating microservice interactions in distributed systems, managing document review and regulatory submission workflows, and coordinating multi-step data pipelines. Modern engines like Temporal and Camunda 8 are designed for cloud-native deployment and horizontal scaling.
