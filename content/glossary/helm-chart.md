Helm is the package manager for Kubernetes. A Helm chart is a collection of templated Kubernetes manifest files that define all the resources needed to deploy an application: deployments, services, config maps, secrets, ingress rules, and more. Charts enable repeatable, parameterized deployments across environments.

## How It Works

A Helm chart contains template files (Kubernetes manifests with variable placeholders), a `values.yaml` file (default configuration values), and metadata (`Chart.yaml`). When you install a chart, Helm renders the templates with the provided values and applies the resulting manifests to the Kubernetes cluster.

Different environments (dev, staging, production) use different values files while sharing the same chart templates. This ensures consistency across environments while allowing environment-specific configuration (replica count, resource limits, feature flags).

## Why It Matters

Without Helm, deploying a Kubernetes application requires managing many individual YAML files, manually substituting values for each environment, and tracking which resources belong together. Helm bundles everything into a versioned, distributable package with built-in templating, dependency management, and rollback capability.

For AI platforms on Kubernetes, Helm charts package inference services, monitoring stacks (Prometheus + Grafana), message queues, and data pipelines as reusable, versionable units.

## Practical Guidance

**Version your charts** in source control alongside application code. Use semantic versioning for chart versions.

**Keep values files per environment** - one for dev, one for staging, one for production. Store production values in a secure location.

**Use Helm hooks** for database migrations, pre-deployment health checks, and post-deployment smoke tests.

**Chart repositories** (ECR OCI, ChartMuseum, S3) store and distribute charts across teams. Publish charts to a shared repository for reuse.

**Combine with GitOps** - tools like ArgoCD and Flux watch your chart repository and automatically apply changes when a new chart version is pushed. This provides audit trails, rollback capability, and declarative deployment management.

Avoid over-templating. If values files become as complex as the manifests they configure, the chart is too generic. Charts should be opinionated about application architecture and flexible about environment-specific settings.
