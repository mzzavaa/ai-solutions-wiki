A compound AI system is an architecture that tackles complex tasks by combining multiple AI models, retrieval systems, external tools, and programmatic logic into a coordinated pipeline, rather than relying on a single monolithic model. The term was popularized by researchers at UC Berkeley's AI research lab (BAIR) to describe the shift from improving individual models to engineering systems of interacting components.

## Why Compound Systems

Individual models have inherent limitations. They hallucinate, lack access to current information, cannot perform precise calculations, and have fixed context windows. Compound systems address these limitations by routing different subtasks to the most appropriate component. A retriever provides current factual information. A code interpreter handles calculations. A specialized model handles domain-specific analysis. Programmatic logic enforces business rules and validates outputs.

## Common Components

Compound AI systems typically include one or more LLMs for reasoning and generation, vector databases and retrievers for knowledge access (RAG), tool-use interfaces for interacting with external APIs and databases, programmatic validators for output checking, routing logic that directs queries to appropriate models or paths, and memory systems that maintain state across interactions.

## Design Patterns

Key patterns include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where a retriever supplements the model's knowledge. Multi-model routing directs queries to different models based on complexity or domain. Tool-use patterns let the model invoke calculators, search engines, or APIs. Verification loops check model outputs against constraints before returning results. Agentic patterns give the system autonomy to plan and execute multi-step workflows.

## Operational Complexity

Compound systems introduce engineering challenges absent in single-model deployments. Each component has its own failure modes, latency characteristics, and cost profile. End-to-end evaluation requires testing component interactions, not just individual parts. Observability must trace requests through multiple components. And optimization requires understanding bottlenecks across the full pipeline rather than just improving one model.

The shift toward compound AI systems reflects a maturation of the field from model-centric to systems-centric thinking, where engineering and architecture matter as much as model quality.
