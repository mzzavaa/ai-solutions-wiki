Synthetic data is artificially generated data that mimics the statistical properties and structure of real-world data without containing actual records from real individuals, transactions, or events. It is created by algorithms -- statistical models, generative AI, simulation engines, or rule-based systems -- and used as a substitute for or supplement to real data in ML training, testing, and development.

## Why Use Synthetic Data

**Privacy compliance** - Real data containing personal information is subject to GDPR, HIPAA, and other regulations that restrict its use for development and testing. Synthetic data that does not correspond to real individuals can be used without privacy constraints, enabling development teams to work with realistic data without accessing protected records.

**Data scarcity** - Some ML tasks have limited labeled data, particularly for rare events (fraud, equipment failure, rare diseases). Synthetic data can augment real data by generating additional examples of underrepresented classes, improving model performance on minority classes.

**Edge case coverage** - Real-world datasets may not contain sufficient examples of edge cases and boundary conditions. Synthetic data can deliberately generate these scenarios to test model robustness.

**Cost reduction** - Collecting and labeling real data is expensive and slow. Synthetic data can be generated at scale for a fraction of the cost, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation.

## Generation Methods

**Statistical models** - Fit a statistical distribution to real data and sample from it. Simple approaches use marginal distributions per column; more sophisticated methods capture correlations using copulas or Bayesian networks.

**Generative adversarial networks (GANs)** - A generator network learns to produce synthetic samples that a discriminator network cannot distinguish from real data. Produces high-fidelity synthetic data but requires careful training and evaluation.

**Large language models** - LLMs can generate synthetic text data, conversations, and structured records when prompted with format specifications and domain context. Useful for generating training data for NLP tasks.

**Simulation engines** - Domain-specific simulators generate data based on physical, economic, or behavioral models. Autonomous vehicle training data from driving simulators is a prominent example.

## Limitations

Synthetic data is only as good as the model that generates it. If the generation model does not capture important patterns or distributions in the real data, models trained on synthetic data will underperform on real-world inputs. Validation against real data is essential: train on synthetic data, but always evaluate on real data. Synthetic data can also amplify biases present in the seed data used to train the generator. Regular audits comparing synthetic data distributions against real-world benchmarks are necessary to maintain quality.
