An AI red team is a group of specialists who systematically test AI systems by simulating adversarial attacks, misuse scenarios, and edge cases to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in production. The concept is borrowed from military and cybersecurity practices where a "red team" plays the role of an adversary against the "blue team" defenders.

## Scope of AI Red Teaming

AI red teaming goes beyond traditional security testing. It covers prompt injection and jailbreak attacks, bias and discrimination testing across demographic groups, factual accuracy and hallucination assessment, safety boundary testing (generating harmful content), data extraction attempts (recovering training data), misuse potential evaluation, and robustness testing against adversarial inputs.

## Methodology

AI red teaming typically follows a structured process. The team defines the scope and threat model based on the system's intended use and deployment context. They develop attack scenarios covering known vulnerability categories. Testing is conducted both manually (human red teamers crafting creative attacks) and through automated tools that generate adversarial inputs at scale. Results are documented with severity ratings, reproduction steps, and recommended mitigations.

## Regulatory Context

The EU AI Act requires providers of high-risk AI systems to conduct testing that includes adversarial evaluation. The NIST AI Risk Management Framework recommends red teaming as part of AI risk assessment. Executive Order 14110 (US, 2023) directed NIST to establish red teaming guidelines for AI. Major AI providers including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Microsoft conduct extensive red teaming before releasing new models.

## Building a Red Team

AI red teams need diverse expertise: cybersecurity specialists who understand attack vectors, ML engineers who understand model internals, domain experts who understand misuse scenarios in specific contexts, and social scientists who understand bias and fairness dimensions. External red teaming through bug bounties or contracted assessments complements internal teams by bringing fresh perspectives.

Organizations that lack resources for a dedicated red team can adopt red teaming practices through structured evaluation frameworks, adversarial test suites, and periodic external assessments.
