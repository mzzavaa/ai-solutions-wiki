Toil is manual, repetitive, automatable operational work that scales linearly with service size. In the SRE framework, toil is work that has no lasting value: it keeps the system running but does not permanently improve it. Google's SRE practice targets keeping toil below 50% of an engineer's time, with the remainder spent on engineering work that reduces future toil.

## Characteristics of Toil

Work is toil if it is:

**Manual** - a human runs a script, clicks through a console, or performs a procedure that a machine could do.

**Repetitive** - it happens over and over, not as a one-time task.

**Automatable** - no human judgment is required; it follows a defined procedure.

**Reactive** - it is triggered by an event (an alert, a request, a schedule) rather than being proactively planned engineering work.

**Scales with service** - as the service grows, the toil grows proportionally. More users means more manual scaling decisions, more alerts to acknowledge, more access requests to process.

## Common Sources of Toil in AI Systems

**Manual model deployments** - following a checklist to deploy a new model version instead of automating the pipeline.

**Alert response** - acknowledging and resolving alerts that could be auto-remediated (restarting a failed container, scaling up during peak hours).

**Data pipeline maintenance** - manually rerunning failed ETL jobs, fixing data quality issues that recur regularly, manually refreshing vector indexes.

**Access management** - manually provisioning and revoking access to AI resources, model endpoints, and data stores.

**Capacity management** - manually adjusting resource allocation based on usage patterns instead of implementing auto-scaling.

## Why It Matters

Toil consumes engineering capacity that could improve the system. A team spending 80% of its time on toil can only spend 20% on improvements, which means toil tends to increase over time as the system grows. Reducing toil is a compounding investment: each automation frees time for more automation.

## Practical Guidance

Track toil by having the team log manual operational tasks for a sprint. Categorize by time spent, frequency, and automation feasibility. Prioritize automating the highest-frequency, most-automatable tasks first. Use runbooks to document toil tasks, then convert runbooks into automation scripts, then into self-healing systems. Accept that some toil is irreducible - the goal is reduction, not elimination.
