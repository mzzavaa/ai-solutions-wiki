Unsupervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where the model discovers patterns and structure in data without labeled examples. Instead of learning to predict known outputs, the model identifies groupings, relationships, and anomalies in the input data on its own.

## How It Works

The model receives unlabeled data and finds structure through mathematical optimization. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together. Dimensionality reduction algorithms find compact representations that preserve important relationships. Anomaly detection algorithms learn what "normal" looks like and flag deviations.

Unlike supervised learning, there is no single "correct" answer to evaluate against. The quality of unsupervised learning results depends on the choice of algorithm, its parameters, and domain-expert evaluation of whether the discovered patterns are meaningful and useful.

## Common Applications

**Customer segmentation** groups customers by behavior, purchase patterns, or demographics without pre-defining the segments. The model discovers natural groupings that may not match assumptions.

**Anomaly detection** learns the normal distribution of system metrics, transaction patterns, or sensor readings, then flags unusual activity. This is valuable for fraud detection, infrastructure monitoring, and quality control when labeled examples of anomalies are rare.

**Topic modeling** discovers themes across large document collections without predefined categories. Useful for understanding support ticket trends, research literature, or customer feedback at scale.

**Data exploration** reveals structure in high-dimensional data before building supervised models. Understanding clusters and distributions in your data informs feature engineering and model design decisions.

## When to Use Unsupervised Learning

Use unsupervised learning when you have large amounts of data but few or no labels, when you want to discover structure you did not know existed, or as a preprocessing step before supervised learning. It is particularly valuable for exploratory analysis on new datasets where the relevant categories or patterns are not yet defined.

The main limitation is evaluation. Without labels, quantifying model quality requires domain expertise and often subjective judgment. Combine unsupervised results with domain knowledge and validate findings with subject-matter experts before acting on them.
