Snapshot testing is a regression testing technique where you capture the output of a function or component, save it to a file (the snapshot), and compare future outputs against this saved snapshot. If the output changes, the test fails, alerting the developer to review the change and either fix the regression or update the snapshot.

## How It Works

On the first run, the test captures the output and stores it as the golden snapshot. On subsequent runs, the test compares the current output against the stored snapshot. If they match, the test passes. If they differ, the test fails with a diff showing exactly what changed.

Snapshot updates are intentional. When a change is expected (a new feature, a redesigned output format), the developer runs the test suite with an update flag (`--snapshot-update` in pytest, `--updateSnapshot` in Jest) to regenerate the snapshots. The updated snapshots are committed to version control and reviewed in the pull request.

## Application in AI Systems

Snapshot testing is valuable for AI systems in several ways:

**Prompt templates.** Capture the fully rendered prompt and detect when template changes alter the prompt sent to the model. This is deterministic and works with exact-match snapshots.

**Pipeline configuration.** Capture model parameters, feature flags, and pipeline settings. Detect unintentional configuration changes.

**Structural snapshots.** Instead of capturing exact AI output text (which varies), capture the structure: field names, types, and array lengths. This detects when the response shape changes without breaking on content variation.

**Semantic snapshots.** For AI outputs where exact text varies but meaning should be consistent, use semantic similarity comparison instead of string equality. Two responses that express the same idea in different words both pass the test.

## Tools

**pytest-snapshot** and **syrupy** provide snapshot testing for Python. **Jest** includes built-in snapshot testing for JavaScript. For AI-specific needs, custom snapshot comparators that use structural matching or semantic similarity extend these tools to handle non-deterministic outputs.

## Best Practices

Review snapshot diffs carefully in pull requests. A snapshot update should be as intentional as a code change. Keep snapshots small and focused: one snapshot per behavior, not a single massive snapshot of the entire system output. Store snapshots in version control alongside the tests so they are versioned with the code they test.
