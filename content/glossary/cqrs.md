CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is an architectural pattern that uses separate models for reading and writing data. Commands (writes) modify state through a write model optimized for validation and business rules. Queries (reads) retrieve data through a read model optimized for the specific query patterns of consumers.

## How It Works

In a traditional CRUD application, the same data model handles both reads and writes. CQRS splits this into two sides:

**Command side** receives write requests, validates business rules, and persists changes. The write model is normalized, enforces invariants, and is optimized for consistency.

**Query side** serves read requests from denormalized views optimized for each query pattern. Read models can be stored in different databases, formats, or structures depending on what consumers need.

The two sides are synchronized through events: when the command side changes state, it publishes an event that the query side consumes to update its read models. This introduces eventual consistency - read models may lag slightly behind writes.

## Why It Matters

CQRS addresses a fundamental tension: the optimal data model for writes (normalized, consistent, enforcing rules) is rarely the optimal model for reads (denormalized, fast, shaped for specific UI or API needs). Separating them allows each to be optimized independently.

For AI applications, CQRS enables patterns like maintaining a normalized data store for accurate model training (write side) while serving pre-computed inference results, cached predictions, and aggregated analytics through optimized read models (query side).

## When to Use CQRS

CQRS adds complexity and is justified when read and write workloads have very different performance characteristics, when read patterns are diverse (different consumers need different views of the same data), or when you need to scale reads and writes independently. It pairs naturally with event sourcing.

## When Not to Use CQRS

Simple CRUD applications with uniform access patterns do not benefit from CQRS. The added complexity of maintaining two models, synchronizing them, and handling eventual consistency is not justified when a single model serves both reads and writes adequately.
