Inference-time compute refers to the strategy of using additional computational resources during model inference (prediction time) to improve the quality of outputs, rather than relying solely on capabilities learned during training. This approach has emerged as a powerful complement to training-time scaling, demonstrating that spending more compute at inference can sometimes substitute for training larger models.

## Key Techniques

**Chain-of-thought reasoning** prompts the model to show its reasoning steps before reaching a conclusion, using more output tokens but improving accuracy on complex problems. **Self-consistency** generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most common answer, trading compute for reliability. **Tree search** explores multiple solution branches systematically, as used in AlphaProof and similar systems. **Verification and self-correction** has the model check its own outputs and revise them, spending additional tokens to improve quality. **Iterative refinement** generates a draft response and then improves it through multiple passes.

## Scaling Laws

Research from OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and others has shown that inference-time compute follows its own scaling laws. Increasing the compute budget at inference (through longer reasoning chains, more samples, or deeper search) yields predictable improvements in task performance. For some tasks, a smaller model with more inference-time compute can match or exceed a larger model with less inference-time compute.

## Practical Implications

Inference-time compute creates a cost-quality tradeoff that organizations can tune per request. Simple queries can be answered with minimal compute, while complex reasoning tasks receive more. This is the basis for model routing and tiered analysis patterns, where a classifier determines how much inference-time compute a query warrants.

## Production Considerations

More inference-time compute means higher latency and cost per request. Organizations must balance quality improvements against response time requirements and budget constraints. Token budgets, caching, and adaptive compute allocation strategies help manage this tradeoff. The emergence of reasoning-optimized models (like OpenAI's o-series) makes inference-time compute an explicit architectural choice rather than an afterthought.
