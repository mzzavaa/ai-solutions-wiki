Publish-subscribe (pub/sub) is a messaging pattern where publishers emit events to a topic without knowledge of which subscribers will receive them. Subscribers register interest in specific topics and receive all messages published to those topics. This decouples publishers from subscribers completely - neither needs to know about the other.

## How It Works

A publisher sends a message to a topic. The messaging system delivers a copy of the message to every subscriber of that topic. Subscribers can be queues, Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, or other services. Each subscriber processes the message independently.

**Amazon SNS** (Simple Notification Service) is AWS's managed pub/sub service. It supports fan-out to multiple SQS queues, Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, and mobile push notifications. SNS + SQS is the standard fan-out pattern on AWS: SNS distributes the event, and SQS buffers it for each consumer.

## Pub/Sub vs. Message Queue

A message queue delivers each message to exactly one consumer (point-to-point). Pub/sub delivers each message to all subscribers (fan-out). Use a queue when one service should process each message. Use pub/sub when multiple services need to react to the same event.

## Why It Matters

Pub/sub enables event-driven architectures where services react to events rather than being called directly. When a new document is uploaded, an SNS topic notifies multiple independent services: one starts text extraction, another updates the search index, a third triggers compliance scanning. Adding a new subscriber requires no changes to the publisher.

For AI systems, pub/sub enables pipeline architectures where each processing stage publishes results that trigger the next stage. Document ingestion publishes to a topic; embedding generation subscribes and publishes its output to another topic; vector database indexing subscribes to that.

## Practical Guidance

Use SNS with SQS subscriptions for reliable fan-out (each subscriber gets its own queue with retry and dead-letter handling). Use SNS message filtering to route specific event types to specific subscribers without custom routing code. For high-throughput event streaming with replay capability, consider Kafka or Kinesis instead of SNS (which does not retain messages after delivery).
