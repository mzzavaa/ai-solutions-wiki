A single-page application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML document and dynamically updates its content in the browser using JavaScript, rather than loading entirely new pages from the server for each navigation. SPAs intercept link clicks and form submissions, fetch data asynchronously, and re-render the page client-side, producing a fluid experience resembling a native desktop or mobile application.

## Origins and History

The concept of dynamically updating a web page without full page reloads predates the term "single-page application." As early as 2002, Stuart Morris, a programming student at Cardiff University, built a self-contained website at slashdotslash.com that loaded all content within a single page [1]. That same year, engineers at Tibco Software --- Lucas Birdeau, Kevin Hakman, Michael Peachey, and Clifford Yeh --- described a single-page application implementation in what would become US patent 8,136,109.

The concept entered mainstream visibility with Google's launch of Gmail on April 1, 2004. Gmail loaded a single HTML page, then used XMLHttpRequest (XHR) to fetch email data asynchronously and render it client-side. The result was an email client that felt dramatically more responsive than any previous web application. Google Maps, launched in February 2005, used the same technique to load map tiles dynamically without page reloads.

In February 2005, Jesse James Garrett published the essay "Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications," coining the term AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to describe the technique that Gmail and Google Maps had popularized [2]. The essay gave developers a vocabulary and conceptual framework for the pattern. The term "single-page application" itself is attributed to Steve Yen, who used it in a 2005 blog post, though the concept had been discussed in various forms since at least 2003 [3].

## The Framework Era

AJAX techniques proliferated through libraries like Prototype (2005) and jQuery (2006), which simplified XHR calls and DOM manipulation. However, these tools addressed individual interactions, not full application architecture.

The SPA framework era began with Backbone.js (Jeremy Ashkenas, 2010), which provided a minimal MVC structure --- models, views, collections, and a router --- for organizing client-side applications. AngularJS (Google, 2010) offered a more comprehensive framework with two-way data binding, dependency injection, and a directive system. Ember.js (Yehuda Katz, 2011) provided an opinionated, convention-over-configuration approach with a sophisticated router.

React (Facebook, 2013) shifted the paradigm by introducing a component model and virtual DOM that made SPAs easier to build and maintain at scale. React Router (2014) added declarative client-side routing. Vue.js (Evan You, 2014) offered a progressive framework that could scale from enhancing static pages to powering full SPAs.

## Key Concepts

**Client-side routing.** SPAs use the HTML5 History API (`pushState`, `replaceState`) to update the browser URL without triggering a page load. A client-side router maps URL patterns to component trees, enabling back/forward navigation, deep linking, and bookmarkable URLs.

**Data fetching.** SPAs fetch data from APIs (REST, GraphQL) after the initial page load. This produces a characteristic pattern: the browser downloads the JavaScript bundle, executes it, then makes API calls to fetch the data needed to render the page.

**State management.** Because the page persists across navigations, SPAs must manage application state in memory. Libraries like Redux, MobX, and Zustand emerged to handle complex state that spans multiple views and user interactions.

**Bundle size and code splitting.** SPAs ship the entire application as a JavaScript bundle. As applications grow, this bundle becomes a performance liability. Code splitting (loading route-specific code on demand) mitigates this by deferring JavaScript that is not needed for the current view.

## Limitations and the Post-SPA Shift

SPAs introduced tradeoffs that became increasingly problematic at scale: poor initial load performance (blank page until JavaScript downloads and executes), SEO difficulties (search engines initially could not index JavaScript-rendered content), accessibility challenges with client-side routing, and the "loading spinner" problem where users see empty shells while data fetches.

These limitations drove the pendulum back toward server-rendered architectures. Next.js, Remix, and Astro reintroduced server rendering while preserving the interactive benefits of SPAs. The term "multi-page application" (MPA) re-emerged to describe server-rendered sites with selective client-side interactivity, and "transitional apps" (Rich Harris, 2021) described the spectrum between pure SPAs and pure MPAs.
