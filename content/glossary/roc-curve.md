A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve plots the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate at every possible classification threshold. The Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) summarizes overall model discrimination ability as a single number between 0.5 (random) and 1.0 (perfect).

## How It Works

A classifier produces a confidence score for each prediction. The classification threshold determines the cutoff: scores above the threshold are classified as positive, below as negative. Different thresholds produce different true positive rates and false positive rates.

The ROC curve plots all these operating points. A curve hugging the top-left corner indicates strong discrimination. A curve along the diagonal indicates no better than random guessing.

**AUC interpretation** - AUC = 0.9 means that a randomly chosen positive example receives a higher score than a randomly chosen negative example 90% of the time. AUC is threshold-independent, making it useful for comparing models without committing to a specific threshold.

## Why It Matters

ROC analysis separates two decisions: (1) how well does the model distinguish between classes? and (2) what threshold should we use in production? The ROC curve answers the first question; business requirements answer the second.

For technical leaders, AUC provides a single model-quality metric for comparing classifiers, independent of the deployment threshold. This is useful during model selection. The threshold decision should then be made based on the business cost of false positives versus false negatives at the chosen operating point.

## ROC vs. Precision-Recall

ROC curves can be misleading on imbalanced datasets. When the negative class vastly outnumbers the positive class, even a high false positive rate corresponds to many false positives in absolute terms, but the ROC curve looks good because the FPR denominator (total negatives) is large.

For imbalanced problems (fraud detection, rare disease screening, anomaly detection), precision-recall curves are more informative because they focus on the positive class and directly show the practical tradeoff between false alarms and missed detections.

## Practical Guidance

Use AUC for model comparison during development. Use precision-recall analysis for threshold selection in production. Report both when communicating model performance to stakeholders. If AUC is below 0.7, the model likely lacks sufficient discrimination for production use; investigate feature engineering, data quality, or model architecture before investing in threshold optimization.
