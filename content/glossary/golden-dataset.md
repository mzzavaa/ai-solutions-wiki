A golden dataset is a curated, human-reviewed collection of test cases used as the ground truth for evaluating AI system quality. Each entry contains an input, the correct or expected output, and often additional metadata like difficulty level, category, and evaluation criteria. The golden dataset serves as a stable benchmark: when the system is changed, running it against the golden dataset reveals whether quality improved, regressed, or stayed the same.

## Structure

A typical golden dataset entry for a RAG system:

```json
{
  "id": "golden_042",
  "question": "What was the company's Q3 2025 revenue?",
  "expected_answer": "The company reported $10.2 million in Q3 2025 revenue.",
  "required_facts": ["$10.2 million", "Q3 2025"],
  "source_document": "quarterly_report_q3_2025.pdf",
  "difficulty": "easy",
  "category": "financial_data",
  "min_score": 0.8
}
```

For classification tasks, entries contain the input and the correct label. For generation tasks, entries may include a reference answer, a list of required facts, or a rubric for scoring.

## Building a Golden Dataset

Start by collecting representative inputs from production logs, user research, or domain experts. Generate outputs from your current pipeline. Have domain experts review and correct the outputs, producing the ground truth. Label each case with metadata (difficulty, category) for stratified analysis. Aim for 100-500 entries that cover the full range of expected inputs, including edge cases and known difficult scenarios.

## Using Golden Datasets

Run the golden dataset through your pipeline and measure quality metrics: accuracy, faithfulness, relevance, or whatever metrics matter for your use case. Set thresholds: "The system must score above 85% on the golden dataset." Run this evaluation in CI on every merge to main and on a nightly schedule. When the score drops below the threshold, investigate before deploying.

## Versioning and Maintenance

Golden datasets evolve as the system changes. When the model intentionally changes behavior (new output format, expanded capabilities), update the golden dataset to reflect the new expectations. Version the dataset (`golden_v1`, `golden_v2`) and document why each update was made. Never silently update golden data to make failing tests pass. Every update should be a reviewed, intentional decision.

## Common Mistakes

Building a golden dataset from only easy cases, then being surprised when the system fails on hard production queries. Letting the dataset go stale as the product evolves, so it no longer represents real usage. Making the dataset too small (under 50 cases), which produces unreliable metrics with wide confidence intervals. Using model-generated golden answers without human review, which embeds the model's biases into the benchmark.
