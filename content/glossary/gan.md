A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a generative model architecture consisting of two neural networks trained in opposition: a generator that creates synthetic data and a discriminator that tries to distinguish synthetic data from real data. Through this adversarial process, the generator learns to produce increasingly realistic outputs.

## How It Works

The generator takes random noise as input and produces synthetic data (typically images). The discriminator receives both real data from the training set and synthetic data from the generator, and classifies each as real or fake. Both networks are trained simultaneously: the discriminator improves at detecting fakes, which forces the generator to produce more convincing outputs.

Training converges (ideally) when the discriminator can no longer distinguish generated data from real data - the generator has learned the underlying data distribution. In practice, GAN training is notoriously unstable, prone to mode collapse (the generator produces limited variety) and training divergence.

## Where GANs Are Used

**Synthetic data generation** creates realistic training data when real data is scarce, sensitive, or expensive to collect. Medical imaging, financial transactions, and manufacturing defect images are common applications.

**Image-to-image translation** transforms images from one domain to another: sketches to photos, day to night, satellite images to maps. Pix2Pix and CycleGAN are well-known architectures for this.

**Super-resolution** upscales low-resolution images with realistic detail, used in media, satellite imagery, and medical imaging.

**Data augmentation** expands training datasets with realistic variations, improving downstream model performance.

## GANs vs. Diffusion Models

Diffusion models have largely replaced GANs for text-to-image generation due to better training stability, higher image quality, and greater output diversity. However, GANs remain relevant for real-time applications (single forward pass vs. iterative denoising), image-to-image translation tasks, and video generation where inference speed matters.

## Practical Considerations

For most enterprise use cases, pre-trained generative models (diffusion-based or GAN-based) available through APIs are more practical than training custom GANs. Custom GAN training requires deep expertise in training stabilization, significant GPU compute, and careful evaluation of output quality and diversity.
