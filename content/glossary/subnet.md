A subnet is a subdivision of a VPC's IP address range, placed in a specific availability zone. Subnets segment your network into logical sections with different access controls and routing rules. Each resource launched in a VPC (EC2 instance, RDS instance, ECS task, Lambda function) is placed in a specific subnet.

## How It Works

Each subnet is associated with a route table that determines where network traffic is directed. A subnet is considered "public" if its route table includes a route to an internet gateway (allowing direct internet access) and "private" if it does not.

Resources in the same subnet can communicate freely. Communication between subnets is controlled by network ACLs (stateless packet filters at the subnet boundary) and security groups (stateful firewalls at the resource level).

## Subnet Architecture Best Practices

**Multi-AZ design** - create subnets in at least two availability zones. If one AZ experiences an outage, resources in the other AZ continue operating. This is the minimum for production workloads.

**Public/private separation** - use public subnets only for resources that must be internet-accessible (load balancers, NAT gateways). Place everything else (application servers, databases, inference endpoints) in private subnets.

**Tiered architecture** - many organizations use three tiers: public subnets (load balancers), private application subnets (compute), and private data subnets (databases). Each tier has its own network ACL rules, limiting blast radius if one tier is compromised.

**CIDR sizing** - allocate subnet CIDR blocks large enough for growth. A /24 subnet provides 251 usable IPs; a /20 provides over 4,000. Running out of IPs in a subnet requires creating a new subnet, which is disruptive.

## Why It Matters

Subnet design directly affects security posture, availability, and operational flexibility. Poor subnet architecture (everything in public subnets, single AZ, undersized CIDR blocks) creates security vulnerabilities, single points of failure, and scaling constraints that are expensive to remediate later. Getting subnet design right from the start is one of the highest-leverage infrastructure decisions.
