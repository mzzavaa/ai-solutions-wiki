Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides traffic management, security, and observability for microservices running on Kubernetes. It uses Envoy sidecar proxies injected into each pod to intercept and manage all network traffic between services, controlled by a central control plane.

## How It Works

Istio injects an Envoy proxy sidecar into every pod. All traffic to and from the application container passes through this proxy. The Istio control plane (istiod) configures these proxies with routing rules, security policies, and telemetry collection.

**Traffic management** - canary deployments, A/B testing, traffic shifting, circuit breaking, retries, timeouts, and fault injection are configured declaratively through Istio custom resources (VirtualService, DestinationRule).

**Security** - mutual TLS between all services is automatic. Authorization policies control which services can communicate. Certificate rotation is handled by the mesh.

**Observability** - distributed tracing (Jaeger), metrics (Prometheus), and service-level dashboards (Kiali, Grafana) are available without instrumenting application code.

## Why It Matters

For AI platforms with many microservices (model serving, feature stores, data pipelines, orchestrators), Istio provides consistent security, traffic management, and observability without modifying application code. Canary deployments for new model versions, traffic shifting during A/B tests, and circuit breaking for flaky downstream services are all configured as infrastructure rather than application logic.

## When to Use Istio

Istio is appropriate for organizations running 15+ microservices on Kubernetes that need mutual TLS, advanced traffic management, and unified observability. The operational overhead (additional resource consumption, proxy latency, upgrade complexity, debugging difficulty) is significant.

## When Not to Use Istio

For smaller deployments, simpler alternatives exist. AWS App Mesh provides service mesh capabilities for ECS and EKS with less operational overhead. Linkerd is a lighter-weight service mesh. For basic traffic management, Kubernetes native features (services, ingress controllers) may suffice.

## Practical Guidance

Start with Istio's ambient mode (no sidecars, ztunnel-based) for simpler operations. Enable features incrementally - start with mTLS and observability before adding complex traffic management. Monitor the resource overhead of Envoy sidecars (typically 50-100 MB memory per pod). Plan for the platform engineering investment required to operate Istio reliably.
