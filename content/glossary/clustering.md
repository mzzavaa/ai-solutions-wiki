Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters based on similarity, without predefined labels. Points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to points in other clusters. Clustering discovers natural structure in data, enabling segmentation, anomaly detection, and exploratory analysis.

## Common Algorithms

**K-means** partitions data into K clusters by iteratively assigning points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids. Fast and scalable, but assumes spherical clusters of similar size and requires specifying K in advance.

**DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering) groups points that are closely packed together and marks isolated points as outliers. Does not require specifying the number of clusters and can discover arbitrarily shaped clusters. Sensitive to the distance threshold and minimum points parameters.

**Hierarchical clustering** builds a tree of nested clusters by iteratively merging (agglomerative) or splitting (divisive) clusters. Produces a dendrogram that shows cluster relationships at all levels. Useful for understanding hierarchical structure but does not scale well to large datasets.

**Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)** model data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions, assigning each point a probability of belonging to each cluster. More flexible than K-means (supports elliptical clusters) and provides soft cluster assignments.

## Enterprise Applications

**Customer segmentation** groups customers by behavior for targeted marketing, product recommendations, and service differentiation.

**Document clustering** organizes large document collections by topic for discovery, deduplication, and routing.

**Anomaly detection** identifies data points that do not belong to any cluster, flagging potential fraud, defects, or security incidents.

**Data preprocessing** creates meaningful groupings that serve as features for supervised models or reduce the complexity of large datasets.

## Practical Guidance

Choosing K (the number of clusters) is the hardest part. Use the elbow method, silhouette scores, or domain knowledge to select an appropriate number. Always validate clusters with domain experts - statistically distinct clusters are not always meaningful. Normalize features before clustering to prevent high-magnitude features from dominating distance calculations.
