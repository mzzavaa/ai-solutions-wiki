Digital signatures provide cryptographic proof of a document's or message's authenticity and integrity. Digital certificates bind a public key to an identity, enabling trust in digital communications. Together, they form the foundation of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

## Origins and History

Digital signatures became practically possible with the invention of public-key cryptography by Diffie and Hellman (1976) and the RSA algorithm (1977). The concept of a certification authority was formalized in the X.509 standard, first published by the ITU-T in 1988 as part of the X.500 directory services specification. X.509 version 3 (1996) added extensions that made certificates flexible enough for internet use. The deployment of SSL (Netscape, 1994) and later TLS created massive demand for X.509 certificates to authenticate web servers. The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) was proposed by NIST in 1991 and standardized in FIPS 186 (1994). The introduction of Let's Encrypt in 2015 democratized certificate issuance by providing free, automated certificates, dramatically increasing HTTPS adoption across the web.

## How It Works

To create a **digital signature**, the signer hashes the message and encrypts the hash with their private key. The recipient decrypts the signature with the signer's public key and compares it to their own hash of the message. A match proves both authenticity (the signer holds the private key) and integrity (the message was not altered). A **digital certificate** is a data structure containing a public key, identity information, validity period, and the digital signature of a Certificate Authority (CA) that vouches for the binding. **Certificate chains** link end-entity certificates through intermediate CAs to a trusted root CA. Browsers and operating systems ship with pre-installed root CA certificates that form the trust anchors.

## Practical Applications

Digital signatures and certificates are used for TLS/SSL (HTTPS website authentication), code signing (software distribution integrity), email signing (S/MIME), document signing (PDF, legal documents), and mutual TLS authentication between services. Certificate lifecycle management -- issuance, renewal, revocation, and monitoring -- is a critical operational concern for organizations.
