A multimodal model is a neural network that can process and reason across multiple data types -- text, images, audio, video, or other modalities -- within a single architecture. Unlike specialized models that handle one input type, multimodal models accept mixed inputs and can generate outputs in one or more modalities. GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude are prominent examples that understand both text and images, with some supporting audio and video as well.

## How It Works

Most multimodal models use a shared transformer backbone with modality-specific encoders on the input side. Images are processed through a vision encoder (often a ViT or CNN) that produces a sequence of visual tokens. Audio is converted to spectrograms and encoded similarly. These tokens are projected into the same embedding space as text tokens and concatenated into a single sequence that the transformer processes uniformly.

**Early fusion** interleaves modality tokens from the start, allowing cross-modal attention at every layer. **Late fusion** processes modalities independently through separate encoders before combining representations at higher layers. GPT-4o uses a natively multimodal architecture trained end-to-end across text, vision, and audio. Gemini processes interleaved sequences of different modalities natively. Other approaches like LLaVA connect a frozen vision encoder to a language model through a lightweight projection layer.

## Why It Matters

Multimodal models collapse the complexity of building separate vision, language, and audio systems into a single model that understands relationships across modalities. This enables applications like visual question answering, document understanding (reading charts and diagrams), video summarization, and assistants that can see and hear. For enterprises, multimodal capability means processing invoices, engineering drawings, photographs, and meeting recordings with one model rather than maintaining separate ML pipelines.

## Practical Considerations

Multimodal inference costs more than text-only processing because image and audio tokens are added to the context. A single image may consume 500-2000 tokens depending on resolution. Evaluate whether multimodal capability is necessary for your use case or whether a text extraction preprocessing step is sufficient. For document processing, compare multimodal LLM accuracy against specialized OCR pipelines. Latency and cost scale with the total number of tokens across all modalities.
