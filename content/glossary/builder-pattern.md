The Builder pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, so that the same construction process can create different representations. It is particularly useful when an object requires numerous steps or configurations to be created properly.

## Origins and History

The Builder pattern was defined by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* (1994). The pattern addressed a recurring problem in software construction: objects that require elaborate initialization with many parameters, optional components, or specific construction sequences. Joshua Bloch later popularized a simplified variant in *Effective Java* (2001, 2nd ed. 2008), where the Builder replaces telescoping constructors and provides a fluent API for constructing immutable objects.

## How It Works

The classical GoF Builder involves four participants. The **Builder** interface declares construction steps for each part of the product. A **ConcreteBuilder** implements those steps and maintains the product being assembled. The **Director** defines the order in which construction steps are called, encapsulating the construction algorithm. The **Product** is the complex object being built.

The Director calls builder methods in sequence. Different ConcreteBuilders produce different representations from the same construction process. The client retrieves the finished product from the builder after construction completes.

The Bloch variant simplifies this: the Builder is a static inner class of the product, with setter-like methods that return the builder itself (enabling method chaining), and a `build()` method that validates parameters and returns the immutable product.

## When to Use It

Builder is appropriate when the algorithm for creating a complex object should be independent of the parts and how they are assembled, when the construction process must allow different representations, or when you need to construct an object step by step. It is also the preferred solution for classes with many optional parameters, replacing long constructor parameter lists.

## Common Pitfalls

The pattern adds complexity by requiring separate builder classes. For simple objects with few parameters, a constructor or factory method is more straightforward. Mutable builders can also introduce bugs if reused improperly between builds, since internal state may carry over.
