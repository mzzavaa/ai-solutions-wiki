Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style in which application components provide services to other components over a network using standardized communication protocols. Services are self-contained, loosely coupled, and expose well-defined interfaces, enabling reuse and interoperability across organizational boundaries.

## Origins and History

SOA emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a response to the integration challenges of enterprise computing. The concept built on earlier work in distributed computing, CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture, OMG, 1991), and component-based software engineering. Gartner analysts described the SOA concept in 1996, and the style gained widespread adoption with the maturation of web services standards: SOAP (1998), WSDL (2000), and UDDI (2000). The WS-* stack of specifications (WS-Security, WS-ReliableMessaging, WS-Transactions) addressed enterprise requirements. Thomas Erl's *SOA: Principles of Service Design* (2007) codified design principles including service autonomy, statelessness, discoverability, and composability. SOA influenced and was partially succeeded by microservices architecture, which adopted SOA's service decomposition principles while favoring lightweight protocols (REST, messaging) over the WS-* stack.

## Core Principles

SOA is governed by several principles. **Loose coupling** minimizes dependencies between services. **Service abstraction** hides internal implementation details behind a contract. **Service reusability** designs services for use across multiple consumers and contexts. **Service composability** enables services to be combined into higher-level business processes, often through orchestration (a central coordinator using BPEL) or choreography (services collaborate based on events). An **Enterprise Service Bus (ESB)** acts as middleware for routing, transformation, and mediation between services.

## Practical Applications

SOA is used in large enterprises for integrating heterogeneous systems (ERP, CRM, legacy mainframes), exposing business capabilities as reusable services, and enabling B2B integration through standardized interfaces. While microservices have become the preferred pattern for new systems, SOA principles remain relevant in enterprise integration and many organizations maintain SOA-based architectures.
