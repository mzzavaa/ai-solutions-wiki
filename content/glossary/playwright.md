Playwright is an open-source browser automation framework developed by Microsoft. It supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers through a single API, enabling cross-browser testing with a single test suite. Playwright is available for Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, and .NET.

## Key Features

**Cross-browser support.** One test runs on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit without modification. This is critical for AI applications that must work consistently across browsers.

**Network interception.** Playwright can intercept, modify, or mock any network request. For AI applications, this means mocking LLM API responses, simulating streaming Server-Sent Events, and testing error handling for API failures, all without changing application code.

**Auto-waiting.** Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable before interacting with them. When testing AI applications where responses take seconds to appear, this reduces the need for explicit sleep statements or polling loops.

**Browser contexts.** Playwright creates isolated browser contexts that share a single browser process. Tests run in parallel without interfering with each other, and each context has its own cookies, storage, and state.

**Tracing and debugging.** Playwright records traces (screenshots, network logs, DOM snapshots at each step) that can be viewed in a trace viewer. This is invaluable for debugging failing E2E tests in CI where you cannot see the browser.

## Why Playwright Suits AI Applications

AI applications have specific E2E testing needs that Playwright handles well. Streaming chat interfaces send tokens via Server-Sent Events, which Playwright's network interception can mock precisely. AI responses take seconds to generate, and Playwright's async-first design handles long waits without awkward workarounds. Network interception allows mocking the AI backend while letting all other requests pass through, giving you deterministic tests of non-deterministic systems.

## Comparison with Alternatives

Playwright is generally preferred over Cypress for AI application testing due to its superior network interception, native multi-tab support, and better handling of async operations. Cypress offers a simpler API and built-in dashboard but has architectural constraints (runs inside the browser) that limit its flexibility for complex AI testing scenarios. Selenium remains relevant for legacy projects but lacks Playwright's modern developer experience and debugging tools.

## Getting Started

Install with `pip install playwright && playwright install` (Python) or `npm init playwright@latest` (Node.js). Playwright downloads browser binaries automatically and provides a code generator (`playwright codegen`) that records user interactions and generates test scripts.
