Reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. Unlike supervised learning, the agent is not given correct answers - it discovers optimal behavior through trial and error.

## How It Works

An RL system has four components: an agent (the decision-maker), an environment (the world the agent acts in), actions (what the agent can do), and rewards (feedback signals). At each step, the agent observes the current state, takes an action, receives a reward, and transitions to a new state. Over many episodes, the agent learns a policy - a mapping from states to actions that maximizes cumulative reward.

Key algorithms include Q-learning (learns the value of state-action pairs), policy gradient methods (directly optimize the policy), and actor-critic methods (combine both approaches). Deep reinforcement learning uses neural networks to handle high-dimensional state and action spaces.

## Why It Matters Today

The most visible application of RL in modern AI is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which is used to align large language models with human preferences. After pre-training, the model is fine-tuned using RL with human preference judgments as the reward signal. This is how models learn to be helpful, harmless, and honest rather than simply predicting the next token.

## Enterprise Applications

**Resource optimization** - RL agents learn to optimize data center cooling, network routing, supply chain logistics, and dynamic pricing by continuously adapting to changing conditions.

**Robotics and automation** - RL trains robots to perform physical tasks like warehouse picking, assembly, and navigation in environments too complex for hand-coded rules.

**Recommendation systems** - RL models long-term user engagement rather than single-click predictions, learning recommendation policies that optimize user satisfaction over time.

## Practical Considerations

RL is harder to deploy than supervised learning. It requires a well-defined reward function (reward hacking is a real risk), a safe environment for exploration (you cannot let an RL agent experiment with production systems freely), and significant compute for training. Most enterprise teams encounter RL indirectly through RLHF-aligned language models rather than building RL systems from scratch.
