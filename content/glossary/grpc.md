gRPC is a high-performance, open-source remote procedure call (RPC) framework originally developed by Google. It uses HTTP/2 for transport, Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for serialisation, and provides features like bidirectional streaming, flow control, and deadline propagation out of the box.

For service-to-service communication in AI systems, gRPC offers significant performance advantages over REST/JSON: smaller payloads, faster serialisation, multiplexed connections, and native streaming support.

## Protocol Buffers

Protocol Buffers are gRPC's interface definition language and serialisation format. You define your service contract in a `.proto` file:

```protobuf
service InferenceService {
  rpc Predict(PredictRequest) returns (PredictResponse);
  rpc StreamPredict(PredictRequest) returns (stream TokenResponse);
}

message PredictRequest {
  string model_id = 1;
  repeated float features = 2;
}
```

From this definition, the protobuf compiler generates client and server code in Python, Go, Java, C++, and other languages. The generated code handles serialisation, deserialisation, and transport. You implement the business logic; gRPC handles the plumbing.

Protobuf serialisation produces binary payloads that are 3-10x smaller than equivalent JSON and 5-20x faster to parse. For ML services passing large feature vectors or embedding arrays, this difference matters.

## Streaming RPCs

gRPC supports four communication patterns:

- **Unary** - Single request, single response. Standard RPC. Used for classification, embedding generation, or any single-shot inference.
- **Server streaming** - Single request, stream of responses. Ideal for LLM token generation where the model produces tokens incrementally.
- **Client streaming** - Stream of requests, single response. Used for sending a stream of sensor data for batch classification.
- **Bidirectional streaming** - Both sides stream simultaneously. Used for conversational AI where context flows both directions.

## Why gRPC for ML Services

ML inference services are internal. They do not need browser compatibility (which favours REST/JSON). They pass large numeric arrays where binary serialisation saves bandwidth and CPU. They benefit from HTTP/2 connection multiplexing under high concurrency. And streaming RPCs map naturally to token-by-token LLM generation.

The trade-off: gRPC is harder to debug (binary payloads are not human-readable), requires code generation tooling, and has limited browser support without a proxy like gRPC-Web or Envoy. For public-facing APIs, REST remains the standard. For internal service meshes, gRPC is often the better choice.
