An AI gateway is a centralized infrastructure component that sits between applications and LLM providers, providing routing, governance, monitoring, cost management, and security controls for all AI model interactions. It functions similarly to a traditional API gateway but is purpose-built for the unique requirements of LLM traffic.

## Core Functions

**Routing and load balancing** - The gateway routes requests to different model providers based on cost, latency, capability requirements, or availability. If one provider experiences an outage, the gateway can automatically fail over to an alternative. **Authentication and authorization** - Centralized API key management eliminates the need to distribute provider API keys to individual applications. Access policies control which teams can use which models. **Rate limiting and quotas** - Per-application and per-user rate limits prevent any single consumer from exhausting the organization's API quota or budget. **Cost tracking** - Token consumption is logged and attributed to specific applications, teams, or cost centers, enabling chargeback and budget enforcement.

## Governance Capabilities

Enterprise AI gateways add governance features. Content filtering applies input and output guardrails across all applications. Audit logging captures every request and response for compliance. Data loss prevention (DLP) rules prevent sensitive data from being sent to external model providers. Policy enforcement ensures that only approved models are used for specific use cases.

## Monitoring and Observability

The gateway provides a single point for observing all LLM interactions: latency percentiles, error rates, token consumption trends, cache hit rates, and model performance comparisons. This centralized view is essential for capacity planning, cost optimization, and incident response.

## Available Solutions

AI gateways include open-source options like LiteLLM and Portkey, cloud-native offerings like AWS Bedrock (which acts as a gateway to multiple models), Azure AI Gateway, and enterprise platforms like Kong AI Gateway. Organizations can also build custom gateways using standard reverse proxy infrastructure with LLM-specific middleware.

## When to Adopt

An AI gateway becomes valuable when an organization uses multiple LLM providers, needs centralized cost control, requires consistent security and compliance policies across AI applications, or wants to avoid vendor lock-in by abstracting the provider layer.
