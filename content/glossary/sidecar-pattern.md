The sidecar pattern deploys a helper container alongside your primary application container within the same pod, task, or host. The sidecar shares the same lifecycle, network, and storage as the primary container, extending its functionality without modifying its code. The name comes from the sidecar attached to a motorcycle - it travels with the main vehicle and extends its capacity.

## How It Works

In Kubernetes, a sidecar container runs in the same pod as the application container. They share the same network namespace (communicate via localhost) and can share volumes. In ECS, sidecar containers run in the same task definition. The sidecar starts and stops with the primary container.

The sidecar handles a cross-cutting concern that the primary container should not be responsible for: logging, monitoring, security, or network management.

## Common Use Cases

**Service mesh proxies** (Envoy, Istio) are the most prominent sidecar use case. The proxy sidecar intercepts all network traffic, adding mutual TLS, retries, circuit breaking, and observability without application code changes.

**Log collection** sidecars read application log files and forward them to centralized logging systems (CloudWatch, Elastic Stack). The application writes logs to a file; the sidecar handles shipping.

**Configuration management** sidecars watch for configuration changes and update local files or inject environment variables, enabling dynamic configuration without application restarts.

**Security** sidecars manage certificate rotation, token refresh, or secrets injection, keeping security logic separate from business logic.

## Why It Matters

The sidecar pattern enables separation of concerns at the infrastructure level. Your application container focuses on business logic while sidecars handle operational concerns. This means different teams can own different aspects of the deployment, infrastructure features can be upgraded independently of the application, and the same sidecar can be reused across many services.

## Practical Guidance

Use sidecars for cross-cutting concerns that are shared across many services and benefit from centralized, consistent implementation. Avoid sidecar sprawl - each sidecar adds resource overhead (CPU, memory) and startup latency. Monitor sidecar resource consumption and include it in capacity planning. For simple use cases (basic logging, health checks), consider whether the application can handle the concern directly rather than adding a sidecar.
