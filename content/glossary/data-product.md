A data product is a self-contained unit of data that is treated as a product rather than a byproduct of operational systems. It has a clear owner, a defined interface for consumers, documented quality standards, and is discoverable through a catalog. The concept is central to the data mesh architecture paradigm introduced by Zhamak Dehghani, but applies broadly to any organization that wants to make data reliably available for AI and analytics.

## Characteristics

A well-designed data product exhibits several properties. **Discoverable** - It is registered in a data catalog with metadata describing its contents, schema, freshness, and intended use. **Addressable** - It has a stable, unique identifier and access endpoint. **Trustworthy** - It includes quality metrics, SLAs for freshness and completeness, and lineage information showing where the data originated. **Self-describing** - Its schema, semantics, and usage documentation are part of the product itself. **Interoperable** - It follows organizational standards for formats and interfaces. **Secure** - Access is governed by policies appropriate to the data's classification.

## Why It Matters for AI

AI systems are only as good as their data. Training an ML model on unreliable, undocumented data produces unreliable results. Data products address this by making data quality and provenance explicit. An AI team consuming a data product knows what they are getting: the schema, the freshness guarantee, the completeness SLA, and the lineage. This reduces the time spent on data wrangling and increases confidence in model outputs.

## Data Products vs. Datasets

A dataset is a static collection of records. A data product is an actively managed asset with an owner responsible for its quality, a defined lifecycle, versioning, and consumer support. When the schema changes or quality degrades, the owner is accountable. This product thinking shifts data from a shared resource that nobody owns to a managed asset that somebody is responsible for.

## Implementation

Data products are typically implemented as curated tables or views in a lakehouse or data warehouse, exposed through standardized APIs or query interfaces, registered in a data catalog, and monitored for quality using automated checks.
