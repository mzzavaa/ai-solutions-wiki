Continuous training is the practice of automatically retraining machine learning models on fresh data to maintain performance as data distributions and real-world conditions change. Rather than training a model once and deploying it indefinitely, continuous training establishes an automated pipeline that detects when retraining is needed, executes the training process, validates the new model, and promotes it to production.

## Why Models Need Retraining

ML models are trained on historical data that represents the world at a specific point in time. The world changes. Customer behavior shifts, market conditions evolve, attackers adapt, and new products are introduced. A model trained on last year's data makes predictions based on last year's patterns, which may no longer hold. Without retraining, model performance degrades over time due to data drift and concept drift.

## Retraining Triggers

**Scheduled retraining** - Retrain on a fixed cadence (daily, weekly, monthly) regardless of whether drift has been detected. Simple to implement and appropriate when the domain changes gradually and predictably.

**Performance-triggered retraining** - Monitor model performance metrics in production and trigger retraining when metrics fall below defined thresholds. Requires access to ground truth labels, which may be delayed.

**Drift-triggered retraining** - Monitor input data distributions and trigger retraining when statistically significant drift is detected. Does not require ground truth labels and can respond before performance degrades noticeably.

**Event-triggered retraining** - Retrain in response to specific business events: a new product launch, a regulatory change, a competitor action, or a major market shift.

## Pipeline Safeguards

Automated retraining without safeguards is dangerous. A continuous training pipeline must include validation gates that prevent a bad model from reaching production. Compare the new model against the current production model on a held-out evaluation set. Require that the new model meets minimum performance thresholds and does not regress on any critical metric. Run fairness and bias checks. Validate that the model passes all policy-as-code rules before promotion.

Maintain the ability to roll back to the previous model version instantly if the newly deployed model exhibits unexpected behavior in production. Log every retraining run with full lineage tracking so that any model version can be traced back to its training data, code, and parameters.

## Implementation Considerations

Continuous training pipelines must handle data versioning, compute provisioning, experiment tracking, model validation, and deployment orchestration. Tools like MLflow, SageMaker Pipelines, Kubeflow, and Vertex AI Pipelines provide the infrastructure for building these pipelines. The organizational challenge is often greater than the technical one: establishing clear ownership, approval processes, and monitoring responsibilities for automated model updates.
