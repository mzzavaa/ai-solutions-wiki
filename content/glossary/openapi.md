The OpenAPI Specification (formerly Swagger) is a standard, language-agnostic format for describing REST APIs. An OpenAPI document defines endpoints, request and response schemas, authentication methods, and error formats in a machine-readable YAML or JSON file.

The specification serves as a single source of truth for an API's contract. From this document, tools generate documentation, client SDKs, server stubs, mock servers, and validation middleware. This eliminates the drift between documentation and implementation that plagues hand-maintained API docs.

## Schema-First API Design

In schema-first (or design-first) development, you write the OpenAPI specification before writing code. The workflow:

1. **Design** - Define endpoints, schemas, and error responses in an OpenAPI YAML file
2. **Review** - Stakeholders (frontend, backend, ML teams) review the API contract
3. **Generate** - Produce server stubs, client SDKs, and validation middleware from the spec
4. **Implement** - Fill in the business logic in the generated server stubs
5. **Validate** - Automated tests verify the implementation matches the spec

The alternative - code-first, where the spec is generated from code annotations - is common but produces specifications that reflect implementation quirks rather than intentional design decisions.

## Code Generation

**Server Stubs** - Tools like openapi-generator produce FastAPI, Flask, Express, or Spring Boot server code with request validation, routing, and type-safe models already wired up.

**Client SDKs** - Generate typed clients in Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, and other languages. Consumers of your AI API get a ready-made client with proper types, error handling, and retry logic.

**Documentation** - Swagger UI and Redoc render interactive API documentation from the spec. Users can try API calls directly from the browser.

**Mock Servers** - Prism and other tools serve realistic mock responses based on the spec. Frontend and integration teams can develop against the mock before the real API is ready.

## OpenAPI for AI Services

AI APIs benefit from explicit contracts because their inputs and outputs are often complex: nested objects with feature arrays, confidence scores, metadata, and pagination. A well-defined OpenAPI spec makes these structures unambiguous.

Versioning is particularly important for AI APIs that evolve as models improve. OpenAPI specs make breaking changes visible: a diff between spec versions shows exactly what changed, enabling consumers to assess migration effort.

For internal ML services where performance is critical, gRPC with Protocol Buffers may be preferred. For public-facing AI APIs where developer experience and broad compatibility matter, OpenAPI with REST is the standard.
