A token budget is the maximum number of tokens allocated to a specific LLM request, conversation turn, agent step, or overall workflow. It serves as a control mechanism to manage costs (since LLM API pricing is per-token), bound latency (more tokens means longer generation time), and prevent context window overflow (exceeding the model's maximum context length).

## Why Token Budgets Matter

LLM costs scale directly with token consumption. A single GPT-4 class model call with a full 128K context window can cost several dollars. In production systems handling thousands of requests per hour, uncontrolled token usage leads to unpredictable costs. Token budgets establish predictable spending by capping consumption at the request, user, team, or application level.

## Types of Token Budgets

**Input token budgets** limit how much context is sent to the model. This is particularly important for RAG systems where retrieved documents can fill the context window. Strategies include limiting the number of retrieved chunks, summarizing long documents before inclusion, and truncating conversation history. **Output token budgets** cap the length of generated responses using the max_tokens parameter. **Workflow budgets** limit total token consumption across a multi-step agent workflow, preventing runaway loops where an agent keeps calling the model indefinitely.

## Implementation

Token budgets are enforced at multiple levels. The model API's max_tokens parameter provides a hard cap on output. AI gateways and proxy layers can enforce per-request, per-user, and per-application budgets. Orchestration frameworks can track cumulative token usage across agent steps and terminate workflows that exceed their budget. Monitoring dashboards track token consumption against budgets in real time.

## Optimization Strategies

Organizations reduce token consumption through prompt compression (removing redundant instructions), semantic caching (reusing responses for similar queries), model routing (sending simple queries to cheaper models), context window management (prioritizing the most relevant context), and response length guidelines in system prompts.

Setting appropriate token budgets requires understanding the tradeoff between response quality (which generally improves with more context and longer outputs) and cost efficiency.
