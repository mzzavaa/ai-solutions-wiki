Data mesh is an organizational and architectural approach to data management that decentralizes data ownership to domain teams. Instead of a central data team owning all data pipelines and a monolithic data lake, each business domain (orders, customers, inventory, logistics) owns, produces, and serves its own data as a product.

## Core Principles

**Domain ownership** - the team that generates the data owns its quality, schema, and availability. The orders team owns the orders data product, not a central data engineering team.

**Data as a product** - domain teams treat their data outputs as products with defined interfaces, SLAs, documentation, and quality guarantees. Data consumers should be able to discover and use data products without extensive coordination.

**Self-serve data platform** - a central platform team provides the infrastructure, tooling, and standards that domain teams use to build and serve data products. The platform abstracts away infrastructure complexity so domain teams focus on domain logic.

**Federated governance** - global standards (naming conventions, security policies, interoperability requirements) are defined centrally, but each domain implements them autonomously. This balances standardization with domain autonomy.

## Why It Matters

Data mesh addresses the scaling bottleneck of centralized data teams. As organizations grow, a single data engineering team becomes a bottleneck: every new data request goes through the same team, pipelines become monolithic and fragile, and data quality suffers because the people who understand the data (domain experts) are not the people building the pipelines.

For AI initiatives, data mesh improves data quality (domain experts own their data), reduces time-to-data (no central team bottleneck), and enables domain-specific AI products built by teams that understand both the data and the business context.

## Practical Considerations

Data mesh is an organizational change, not a technology purchase. It requires domain teams that are willing and able to take ownership of data products, a mature platform team that can provide self-serve tooling, and executive support for the cultural shift. It is most appropriate for large organizations with multiple distinct domains. Small organizations with a single data team should not adopt data mesh.
