Programmatic video is the practice of generating video content through code and data rather than through manual editing in timeline-based software. Instead of dragging clips on a timeline, a developer writes a program that describes scenes, animations, transitions, and overlays declaratively or procedurally. The program is then executed to render the final video file. This approach enables version control, parameterization, automated testing, and mass generation of video variants from templates.

## Origins and History

The idea of generating visual media from code has deep roots. Computer-generated imagery (CGI) has been produced programmatically since the 1960s, but the concept of programmatic video as a developer workflow for producing complete, distributable video files emerged more recently, driven by three independent projects.

Grant Sanderson began developing **Manim** (Mathematical Animation Engine) in 2015 to produce the animated mathematics explainers for his YouTube channel 3Blue1Brown [1]. Written in Python, Manim allows developers to define mathematical objects (graphs, vectors, equations rendered via LaTeX) and animate them through programmatic transformations. Manim uses FFmpeg to encode the rendered frames into video. A community fork, ManimCE, was established in 2020 to provide a more stable and documented version for general use.

**Remotion**, created by Jonny Burger and announced in February 2021, brought the programmatic video concept into the React ecosystem [2]. Remotion treats a video as a React application where each frame is an independent render parameterized by a frame number. It uses headless Chromium for frame capture and FFmpeg for encoding. Remotion's key contribution was making video production accessible to the large population of web developers already fluent in React, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Motion Canvas**, an open-source TypeScript library, provides an alternative approach optimized for vector animations and synchronized voice-overs [3]. It uses the HTML Canvas API for rendering and TypeScript generators for programming animation sequences. Motion Canvas ships with a built-in visual editor that provides real-time preview during development, bridging the gap between code-first and GUI-based workflows.

## How Programmatic Video Works

All programmatic video frameworks share a common rendering pipeline. The developer defines a composition: a description of what appears on screen at each point in time. The framework evaluates this description frame by frame, producing an image for each frame. These images are then passed to a video encoder, almost universally FFmpeg, which compresses and packages them into a standard video container format such as MP4 or WebM.

The key differentiator from traditional video editing is that the composition is defined in code. This means a single template can generate thousands of video variants by changing input data. A product demo template can be fed different product names, screenshots, and pricing to produce a unique video for each product. A data visualization template can be fed different datasets to produce weekly report videos automatically.

## Use Cases

Programmatic video is used in automated social media content generation, personalized marketing videos, data-driven dashboards rendered as video, educational content with mathematical animations, developer documentation with animated code walkthroughs, and automated news or sports highlight compilations. The pattern is particularly valuable when video content needs to be produced at a scale or frequency that makes manual editing impractical.

## The Rendering Cost Problem

The primary technical challenge is rendering speed. Capturing a browser screenshot for each frame is slow compared to GPU-accelerated video encoding. A 60-second video at 30 frames per second requires 1,800 individual frame renders. Remotion addresses this with Remotion Lambda, distributing frame rendering across parallel AWS Lambda invocations. Motion Canvas and Manim render locally but benefit from the simpler rendering requirements of vector graphics compared to full browser screenshots.
