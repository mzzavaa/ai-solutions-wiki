Public infrastructure - roads, bridges, water systems, buildings, and utilities - deteriorates over time and requires maintenance to remain safe and functional. Governments manage vast infrastructure portfolios but lack the resources for comprehensive manual inspection. AI monitoring enables continuous assessment of infrastructure condition, early detection of deterioration, and data-driven prioritization of maintenance investments.

## The Problem

Infrastructure inspection is infrequent and subjective. A bridge might be inspected every 2-5 years, with condition assessments varying between inspectors. Between inspections, deterioration goes undetected until it becomes visible or causes a failure. The backlog of deferred maintenance across European infrastructure is estimated in the hundreds of billions of euros.

Budget constraints force difficult prioritization decisions: which roads to repave, which bridges to repair, which water mains to replace. Without objective condition data, these decisions are driven by political factors, complaint volumes, or catastrophic failures rather than systematic risk assessment.

## AI Approach

**Satellite and aerial imagery analysis** - SageMaker computer vision models analyze satellite imagery to detect road surface deterioration (cracks, potholes, rutting), vegetation encroachment, structural changes in buildings and bridges, and land subsidence. Imagery is captured at regular intervals, enabling automated change detection that flags accelerating deterioration.

**Sensor-based monitoring** - Kinesis ingests data from infrastructure sensors: strain gauges on bridges, flow and pressure sensors in water systems, vibration sensors on buildings, and temperature sensors on pavements. SageMaker models detect anomalies that indicate structural issues, leaks, or failure precursors. This continuous monitoring supplements periodic visual inspection.

**Condition scoring and prediction** - Each infrastructure asset receives a condition score based on available data (imagery analysis, sensor readings, inspection records, age, materials, usage patterns). Regression models predict future condition trajectories, estimating when each asset will reach intervention thresholds. This enables proactive maintenance planning rather than reactive repair.

**Investment optimization** - Given the condition predictions and budget constraints, optimization models determine the highest-value maintenance program: which assets to treat, when, and with what intervention type. The optimization maximizes the total network condition improvement per euro invested, subject to safety constraints and minimum service standards.

## Architecture

Satellite imagery is stored in S3 and processed through SageMaker computer vision pipelines. Sensor data streams through Kinesis. Asset inventory and historical inspection data are stored in Redshift. SageMaker models produce condition scores and deterioration predictions. QuickSight dashboards provide asset managers with condition maps, risk rankings, and investment scenario comparisons. Integration with asset management systems triggers work orders for identified maintenance needs.

## Key Considerations

**Data integration** - Infrastructure data is typically distributed across multiple agencies, systems, and formats. Building a unified asset inventory is a prerequisite for AI-driven monitoring.

**Validation against ground truth** - AI condition assessments must be validated against physical inspection for calibration. Initial deployment should run AI assessment alongside inspector assessment to establish correlation and identify systematic biases.

**Safety criticality** - For safety-critical infrastructure (bridges, dams, tunnels), AI monitoring supplements but does not replace mandated inspection programs. AI can prioritize which assets need inspection most urgently.

**Cross-referencing** - Infrastructure monitoring connects to predictive maintenance patterns in manufacturing and energy, environmental monitoring already in the wiki, satellite data analysis in geospatial, and outage prediction in energy.

## Next Steps

Inventory the infrastructure assets under management and assess current data availability (imagery, sensors, inspection records). Select a single asset class (e.g., road network or bridge portfolio) for piloting. Acquire or process available imagery and build the condition assessment model. Validate against recent inspection data. Deploy condition scoring and prioritization for the pilot asset class before expanding to additional infrastructure types.
