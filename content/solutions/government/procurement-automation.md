Government procurement is constrained by policy frameworks that exist for good reasons - preventing conflicts of interest, ensuring fair competition, achieving policy goals like small business participation. The challenge is that these constraints add significant processing overhead to every procurement action. AI can apply compliance checks consistently and at scale without removing the human judgment required for vendor selection.

## Procurement Intake

Every procurement starts with a requirements document: scope of work, technical specifications, evaluation criteria, contract terms. The intake assistant processes this document and checks it against procurement policy requirements before it goes to solicitation.

Common intake checks include: whether evaluation criteria are explicitly weighted, whether the solicitation includes required clauses (socioeconomic participation, data security, accessibility), whether the contract terms reference the correct regulatory frameworks, and whether the scope is sufficiently defined to allow fair bidding.

Issues are flagged with specific references to the policy requirement and the missing or non-compliant element. The procurement officer corrects the solicitation before it is published - catching problems before vendors respond is far less costly than handling protests after.

## Proposal Processing

When vendor proposals arrive, the extraction pipeline processes each submission to pull structured data: proposed price, proposed delivery timeline, technical approach summary, subcontracting plan, certifications claimed, and compliance declarations.

For large procurements with many proposals, manual comparison is time-consuming and inconsistency in how different reviewers read different proposals is a legitimate fairness concern. The extraction layer normalizes across proposals before human review begins.

## Compliance Checking

Each proposal is checked against mandatory compliance requirements:

- Required certifications (business type, security clearances, professional licenses)
- Mandatory contract clauses accepted
- Conflict of interest declarations complete
- Socioeconomic participation plan meets minimum thresholds

Proposals that fail mandatory requirements are flagged as non-compliant with the specific failure identified. These are presented to the procurement officer for final determination - the system does not automatically eliminate proposals, because the human reviewer may have context about whether a waiver process applies.

## Vendor Comparison

For compliant proposals, the comparison layer produces a structured side-by-side view against the solicitation's stated evaluation criteria. Each criterion is scored based on extracted proposal content with a reference to the specific passage supporting the score.

This does not replace the technical evaluation panel. It produces the pre-work that allows the panel to focus their time on substantive technical judgments rather than hunting through 200-page proposals for specific information.

## Audit Trail

Every procurement action generates an audit record: which documents were processed, what was extracted, what compliance checks ran, what flags were raised, and what the human reviewer decided. This supports both internal audit functions and external reviews or protests.

The audit trail is the critical feature for government procurement - not the efficiency gain, though that matters. The ability to demonstrate that every vendor was evaluated against the same criteria applied consistently is what makes the system defensible.
