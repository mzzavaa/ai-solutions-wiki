Social services caseworkers manage high caseloads with complex, often handwritten intake forms, inconsistent documentation quality, and significant consequences for missed risk signals. An AI caseworker assistant does not make decisions - it does the data extraction and pattern recognition work that currently prevents caseworkers from spending time on the parts of their job that require human judgment.

## The Problem with Manual Intake

A typical intake packet includes a referral form, prior case history, third-party agency notes, and sometimes school or medical records. A caseworker processing this manually must read every document, extract relevant facts, cross-reference against prior history, and then develop a picture of the situation before deciding on next steps. For straightforward cases this takes 30-60 minutes. For complex cases with multiple prior interactions and partial documentation it can take much longer.

The risk is not just time - it is consistency. Under high caseload pressure, review depth varies. Risk signals in document 4 of a 6-document packet get missed. The AI assistant addresses this by ensuring every document in every intake is processed completely before the caseworker begins their review.

## Intake Processing

The assistant receives intake documents through a secure upload interface or integration with existing case management systems. Document classification identifies the type of each document (referral, prior case note, external agency report). Extraction pulls structured data: names, dates, prior case numbers, reported incidents, services previously provided.

Named entity resolution links references across documents - the same individual referenced as "the father" in a referral and by name in a prior case note is identified as the same person before the caseworker opens the file.

## Risk Signal Detection

Risk signals are defined by the agency and encoded as explicit rules combined with pattern-based detection:

- Prior case history with escalating severity
- Specific combinations of reported incidents that carry elevated risk
- Missing required documentation for a given referral type
- Time gaps in service history that may indicate prior unrecorded incidents
- Age and household composition combinations that match elevated-risk profiles

When signals are present, they are surfaced on a single flagged summary page at the top of the case file. Each flag includes the specific evidence that triggered it and the document source. The caseworker can validate, dismiss, or escalate each flag individually.

## Next Action Suggestions

Based on intake type, flagged signals, and agency workflow rules, the assistant generates a suggested next action list. These are agency-defined action templates (schedule home visit, request school records, issue 48-hour safety check) triggered by the intake profile. The caseworker accepts, modifies, or replaces the suggestions entirely.

The assistant does not determine whether a child is at risk. It determines whether the documentation contains signals that the agency has decided warrant specific responses. That distinction is critical for both governance and staff acceptance.

## Integration Considerations

The assistant integrates with case management systems through API or batch file exchange depending on what the system supports. For agencies on older systems, a document upload portal plus structured output export is sufficient. For agencies with modern systems, real-time integration enables the assistant to pull prior case data automatically during intake.

Data handling must meet the requirements of applicable regulations for social services data. All processing occurs within the agency's cloud environment - no data leaves the agency boundary. Audit logs capture who reviewed what and when.
