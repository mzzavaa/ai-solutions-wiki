Housing assistance programs face a structural mismatch: demand consistently exceeds supply, intake volumes are high, and the criteria for prioritization are complex enough that manual scoring is inconsistent. AI can standardize intake processing and apply prioritization criteria uniformly - producing fairer outcomes and dramatically faster decisions.

## Intake Processing

Housing assistance applications arrive with varying levels of completeness. Applicants submit income documentation, household composition details, current housing situation, and references to extenuating circumstances. A significant portion of applications are incomplete on first submission.

The intake assistant processes each application document by document. It extracts structured data (household size, income figures, current address status, dates), cross-checks internal consistency (do the income documents support the stated income?), and generates a completeness report. Incomplete applications trigger an automated request for missing items with specific identification of what is needed - not a generic "please resubmit" message.

For agencies that accept handwritten or scanned paper applications, OCR handles initial extraction with a confidence threshold that routes low-confidence fields to human review.

## Eligibility Scoring

Each program has defined eligibility criteria. The scoring engine applies these criteria against extracted application data and produces a binary eligible/ineligible determination with a plain-language explanation of each criterion and whether it was met. For applications close to a threshold, the explanation surfaces the specific factor that determined the outcome.

This is not a black-box score. Every eligibility determination is a structured document showing criterion, required value, extracted value, and result. Applicants can receive this as part of their decision notice.

## Waitlist Prioritization

Eligible applicants join a waitlist. The prioritization criteria typically combine: date of application, household vulnerability indicators (disability status, dependent children, documented emergency), income level relative to area median income (AMI), and local policy priorities (veterans preference, displacement from redevelopment).

The assistant scores each eligible applicant against the prioritization criteria and maintains a ranked waitlist. When a unit becomes available, the system identifies the top-ranked eligible applicant for that unit type (bedroom count, accessibility requirements, location).

Transparent criteria are a governance requirement, not just a design preference. Every ranked position is explainable: "ranked 47th because application date is 2025-08-12, no emergency priority factor, income at 42% AMI." Applicants can see their own position and the factors affecting it.

## Managing Waitlist Changes

Waitlist management is ongoing. Applicants update their situations - household composition changes, income changes, emergency status changes. The assistant processes updates using the same intake pipeline, recalculates scores, and updates waitlist position. Significant position changes generate notifications.

When applicants have been on a waitlist beyond a defined threshold, the system flags them for active outreach to confirm continued interest and update current circumstances.

## What This Does Not Do

The AI system does not make unit assignment decisions or override policy constraints set by the agency. It applies the criteria the agency defines. If those criteria produce outcomes that feel unfair, the fix is to revise the criteria - the system makes those criteria explicit and auditable, which is a prerequisite to improving them.
