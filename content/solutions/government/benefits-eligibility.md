Government benefits programs - social assistance, housing support, disability benefits, unemployment insurance, childcare subsidies - process millions of applications annually. Eligibility determination requires verifying applicant information against complex rule sets that consider income, household composition, employment status, disability status, and other factors. AI automation reduces processing times, improves consistency, and frees caseworkers to focus on complex cases requiring human judgment.

## The Problem

Benefits application processing is a major operational challenge for social services agencies. Processing backlogs create hardship for applicants who need support urgently. Complexity of eligibility rules leads to errors - both false denials (eligible applicants rejected) and false approvals (ineligible applicants receiving benefits). Staff turnover means that institutional knowledge of complex rule interactions is frequently lost.

Applicants face a confusing process: multiple forms, extensive documentation requirements, and uncertainty about eligibility. Many eligible individuals do not apply because the process is too complex or intimidating. Incomplete applications create rework for both applicants and staff.

## AI Approach

**Application assistance** - Bedrock powers a conversational interface that helps applicants understand which programs they may be eligible for and what documentation is needed. The system asks guided questions and pre-screens eligibility before the applicant invests time in a full application. This reduces incomplete applications and ensures applicants apply to appropriate programs.

**Document processing** - Textract extracts data from supporting documents: income statements, employment records, identity documents, medical certificates, and housing documentation. The system validates document authenticity, extracts relevant data points, and flags inconsistencies for review.

**Rules-based eligibility determination** - Step Functions implements the eligibility rules as a structured workflow. Each rule is encoded explicitly and evaluated against the extracted application data. The system produces a determination with a complete explanation: which rules were satisfied, which were not, and what the overall eligibility outcome is. For straightforward applications where all data is clear and rules are unambiguous, automated determination is possible.

**Caseworker decision support** - For complex cases (ambiguous circumstances, incomplete information, exceptional situations), the system prepares a case summary for the caseworker: applicant profile, relevant rules, available evidence, and a preliminary assessment with confidence level. This reduces the caseworker's review time while preserving human judgment for decisions that require it.

## Architecture

Applications are submitted through a citizen-facing web portal or digitized from paper. Textract processes supporting documents. Bedrock powers the conversational assistance layer. Step Functions orchestrates the eligibility workflow, with each rule implemented as a distinct step. DynamoDB stores application state and determination records. Integration with the benefits management system triggers payment processing for approved applications. Complete audit trails support appeals and oversight.

## Key Considerations

**Accuracy and accountability** - Benefits determinations directly affect people's lives. Error tolerance must be extremely low, and all automated decisions must be reviewable by humans. The system should err toward approval for borderline cases, routing them for human review rather than automatic denial.

**Appeals and transparency** - Applicants have the right to understand why they were denied and to appeal. Every determination must produce a clear, human-readable explanation citing specific eligibility criteria.

**Accessibility** - Benefits applicants include vulnerable populations who may have limited digital literacy, disability, or language barriers. The system must be accessible across languages, reading levels, and ability levels.

**Cross-referencing** - Benefits eligibility shares document processing and rule-based assessment patterns with permit processing in government, customer onboarding in finance and insurance, and compliance monitoring in legal.

## Next Steps

Select a benefits program with well-defined, primarily objective eligibility criteria (e.g., income-based housing support). Map the eligibility rules explicitly. Build the document processing and rule evaluation pipeline. Pilot automated determination for the clearest cases (those meeting all criteria by a wide margin) while maintaining manual processing for all other cases. Validate accuracy before expanding the automation boundary.
