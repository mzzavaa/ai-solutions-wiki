The order in which concepts are presented significantly affects learning outcomes. Cognitive science research on spacing effects, interleaving, and prerequisite dependencies provides principles for sequencing, but applying these principles to individual learners across complex curricula requires optimization at a scale that manual curriculum design cannot achieve.

## The Problem

Course designers typically create a single linear sequence of topics based on logical concept dependencies and tradition. This sequence is optimized for an average student who does not exist. Real students have varying prerequisite mastery, forget material at different rates, and benefit from different amounts of practice. A fixed sequence cannot adapt to these individual differences.

Professional training faces a similar challenge: employees need to acquire specific competencies, but their starting knowledge varies widely. A one-size-fits-all training program wastes time for experienced staff and overwhelms newcomers.

## AI Approach

**Knowledge graph construction** - The curriculum is modeled as a directed acyclic graph where nodes are concepts and edges represent prerequisite relationships. SageMaker models trained on historical assessment data validate and refine the prerequisite structure: if students who skip concept A still succeed at concept B, the prerequisite edge may be unnecessary.

**Spaced repetition scheduling** - Forgetting curves are modeled per student and per concept. The system schedules review sessions at intervals calibrated to each student's retention rate, inserting review of previously mastered concepts at the point where recall probability drops below a threshold (typically 85%). DynamoDB stores per-student retention parameters for real-time scheduling.

**Reinforcement learning for sequencing** - A contextual bandit model on SageMaker optimizes concept ordering within the constraints of the prerequisite graph. The reward signal combines assessment performance, time to mastery, and long-term retention. The model learns that some students benefit from examples before theory while others prefer theory first, and adjusts sequencing accordingly.

**Difficulty calibration** - Practice problems are tagged with difficulty levels. The system selects problems that maintain a target success rate (typically 70-85%) - challenging enough to promote learning but not so difficult as to cause disengagement.

## Architecture

The knowledge graph is stored in Amazon Neptune. Student state (current mastery, retention parameters, learning preferences) is maintained in DynamoDB. SageMaker hosts the sequencing model and the retention prediction model. A Lambda-based orchestration layer queries these models to generate the next learning activity for each student interaction. Bedrock generates explanatory content when students need additional support on a concept the sequencing model has selected.

## Key Considerations

**Cold start** - New students have no interaction history. Diagnostic assessments and demographic-based priors provide initial estimates that the system refines as data accumulates. The system should be useful from day one, not only after weeks of data collection.

**Exploration vs. exploitation** - The system must balance exploiting known-effective sequences with exploring alternative orderings that might be better. Pure exploitation converges to local optima; some exploration is necessary for continuous improvement.

**Instructor interpretability** - Instructors should understand why the system chose a particular sequence for a student. Opaque optimization erodes trust. Provide explanations in terms of prerequisite gaps, retention predictions, and learning objectives.

**Completion constraints** - In formal education, students must complete courses within fixed timeframes. The optimization must respect calendar constraints, exam schedules, and institutional requirements, not just optimize for theoretical learning efficiency.

## Next Steps

Map the prerequisite structure of a target course using instructor input and historical assessment correlation analysis. Implement spaced repetition scheduling as a first step - it requires minimal infrastructure and produces measurable retention improvements. Layer in adaptive sequencing once sufficient interaction data has accumulated to train the reinforcement learning model.
