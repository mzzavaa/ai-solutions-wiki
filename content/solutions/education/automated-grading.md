Grading is one of the most time-consuming tasks in education. A university instructor teaching 200 students spends 40-60 hours grading a single essay assignment. This time cost limits the frequency of meaningful assessments and delays feedback to students - often by weeks. AI-powered grading can reduce turnaround to minutes while maintaining consistency that human grading often lacks.

## The Problem

Manual grading has three core limitations: it is slow, inconsistent, and unscalable. Studies show inter-rater reliability for essay grading ranges from 0.6 to 0.8 depending on the rubric clarity and grader training. A single grader's scores drift over a long grading session. And institutions facing enrollment growth cannot proportionally increase grading capacity.

Multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank questions are trivially auto-graded, but they assess only recall and recognition. Higher-order learning outcomes require open-ended responses - essays, short answers, proofs, code - which are precisely the response types that are hardest to grade at scale.

## AI Approach

**Short answer grading** - For responses of 1-5 sentences, a fine-tuned classification model on SageMaker compares student responses against reference answers and a rubric. The model is trained on historically graded responses from the same course, learning to map response features to rubric scores. Accuracy typically reaches 85-90% agreement with expert graders after training on 500+ graded examples per question.

**Essay scoring** - Amazon Bedrock evaluates longer-form writing against detailed rubrics. The prompt includes the rubric, assignment instructions, and any reference materials. The model returns a score for each rubric dimension (argumentation, evidence use, writing quality, originality) along with written feedback. Rubric-anchored prompting - where specific score levels are described with examples - significantly improves scoring consistency.

**Code grading** - Programming assignments benefit from a hybrid approach: automated test cases verify functional correctness, while Bedrock evaluates code quality dimensions (readability, efficiency, design patterns). The test-case pass rate provides an objective baseline; the AI assessment adds qualitative feedback.

## Architecture

Student submissions are uploaded to S3 via the learning management system (LMS) integration. An EventBridge rule triggers a Step Functions workflow that routes submissions to the appropriate grading pipeline based on assignment type. Graded results are written back to the LMS via API, including scores and feedback comments attached to specific parts of the submission.

A human review queue surfaces submissions where the AI confidence is low (typically 10-15% of submissions). Instructors review these edge cases and their corrections feed back into model improvement.

## Key Considerations

**Rubric quality determines AI quality** - Vague rubrics produce vague grading. The investment in writing clear, specific rubrics with anchor examples pays dividends in both AI and human grading consistency.

**Bias monitoring** - Grading models can inherit biases from training data. Regular audits should check for score disparities across demographic groups, writing styles, and first-language backgrounds.

**Student transparency** - Students should know when AI is involved in grading. Institutions that have been transparent about AI grading report higher acceptance when combined with a clear appeals process.

**Feedback over scores** - The greatest value of AI grading is often not the score itself but the immediate, detailed feedback. Systems that emphasize formative feedback see higher student satisfaction than those focused purely on summative scoring.

## Next Steps

Pilot with a high-enrollment course that already has a well-defined rubric and historical grading data. Use the first semester in shadow mode - AI grades alongside human graders, with results compared but only human grades recorded. This builds the evidence base for accuracy before deploying AI grades to students.
