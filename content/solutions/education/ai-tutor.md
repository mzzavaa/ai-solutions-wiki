AI tutoring systems work best when they replace three things: the one-size-fits-all curriculum, the delayed feedback cycle, and the lack of visibility into what a student actually understands versus what they think they understand. A well-designed AI tutor adapts to the individual learner, responds immediately, and tracks progress in ways that static course materials cannot.

## Adaptive Study Plans

The study plan is the core artifact of an AI tutoring system. It is not a static syllabus - it updates based on observed performance.

Initial plan generation starts from an assessment of current knowledge state. A brief diagnostic covering the subject's prerequisite concepts identifies where gaps exist before the main content begins. Students who have strong prerequisites move faster through foundational material. Students with gaps receive targeted remediation before progressing.

The plan is structured as a graph of concepts, not a linear sequence. Each concept has prerequisites. Mastery of a concept unlocks dependent concepts. The student's path through the graph depends on their demonstrated performance - they do not progress past a concept until they demonstrate understanding, and they do not repeat material they have already shown they know.

## Practice Generation

Practice questions are generated dynamically rather than pulled from a fixed bank. Generation is constrained to the current concept, the student's demonstrated ability level, and the specific misconceptions the student has shown.

If a student consistently makes sign errors in algebra, practice problems skew toward contexts where sign handling matters. If a student struggles with word problems but not with symbolic problems, they receive more word problems. The practice does not just drill the topic - it targets the specific failure mode.

## Feedback Loops

Feedback is immediate and specific. When a student answers incorrectly, they receive an explanation of why their answer is wrong and the correct reasoning path - not just the correct answer. When they answer correctly after initial difficulty, the system notes that the concept may need reinforcement and schedules a spaced-repetition review.

The feedback also flows upward: if multiple students make the same error on the same concept, the curriculum for that concept is flagged for review. This is the feedback loop that improves the system over time.

## Progress Tracking

Instructors and students see different views of progress data. Students see their mastery map - which concepts are mastered, in progress, or not yet started. Instructors see class-level patterns: which concepts have low mastery rates, which students are falling behind, which are ready to accelerate.

Progress data drives the adaptive plan. A mastery threshold (typically 80-85% correct on a concept over two or more separate sessions) determines when a concept is considered learned. A concept that was mastered but shows declining performance in subsequent sessions triggers review.

## What AI Tutoring Does Not Replace

Human teachers and the social dimensions of learning are outside the scope of what these systems address. AI tutoring handles the practice, feedback, and adaptation work. It does not handle motivation, social learning, or the relationship-based aspects of teaching that research consistently shows matter for long-term outcomes.

The best implementations treat the AI tutor as the practice and reinforcement layer, with human instruction handling introduction of new concepts and the harder work of building student engagement.
