Standard curricula assume a uniform student population that does not exist. Students enter courses with different background knowledge, learn at different rates, and respond to different instructional modalities. Curriculum personalization uses AI to adapt what is taught, how it is taught, and at what pace - creating individualized learning experiences within a common framework.

## The Problem

A fixed curriculum forces a trade-off between breadth and depth. Students who have already mastered prerequisite concepts waste time reviewing material they know. Students missing prerequisites struggle with material that assumes knowledge they lack. The result is disengagement at both ends: boredom for advanced students and frustration for those behind.

Content creators face a parallel problem: producing multiple versions of materials for different levels is prohibitively expensive. A single course might need beginner, intermediate, and advanced variants of every lesson, along with remediation paths for common knowledge gaps.

## AI Approach

**Prerequisite mapping** - AI analyzes course content and assessment data to build a knowledge graph of concept dependencies. SageMaker models trained on historical student performance data identify which prerequisite gaps predict failure on downstream topics. This graph drives the personalization engine.

**Adaptive content selection** - Amazon Personalize generates recommendations for learning resources based on the student's current knowledge state, learning preferences, and the performance patterns of similar students. If a student struggles with a concept explained through text, the system surfaces a video explanation or interactive simulation instead.

**Dynamic pacing** - Rather than fixed weekly schedules, the system adjusts pacing based on demonstrated mastery. Students who pass a concept assessment quickly move forward; those who need more time receive additional practice without falling behind on the overall timeline, because they skip content they have already mastered elsewhere.

**Content generation** - Bedrock generates supplementary explanations, practice problems, and examples tailored to the student's context. A business student learning statistics receives examples drawn from market data rather than physics experiments. This contextual relevance improves engagement and transfer.

## Architecture

The curriculum personalization system integrates with existing LMS platforms via LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability) standards. The knowledge graph is maintained in Amazon Neptune. Student interaction data flows from the LMS to Kinesis Data Streams, which feeds the real-time personalization engine. Personalize models are retrained weekly on accumulated interaction data. Content assets are stored in S3 and served via CloudFront.

## Key Considerations

**Instructor control** - Personalization should operate within instructor-defined boundaries. The instructor sets the learning objectives, approved content sources, and minimum competency thresholds. The AI optimizes the path, not the destination.

**Coherence** - Fully automated personalization risks producing fragmented learning experiences. Content sequencing should maintain narrative coherence and conceptual flow, not just optimize for predicted mastery scores.

**Equity** - Personalization systems must not create a two-tier experience where some students receive rich, diverse content while others receive only remediation drills. Regular audits should verify that personalization improves outcomes across all student segments.

**Data requirements** - Effective personalization requires substantial interaction data. New courses or small cohorts may not generate enough signal for the recommendation engine. Start with rule-based personalization and transition to ML-based approaches as data accumulates.

## Next Steps

Begin by mapping the prerequisite structure of a high-enrollment course with existing assessment data. Deploy a diagnostic assessment at course entry to identify individual knowledge gaps. Use the results to create two or three differentiated learning paths before investing in fully adaptive personalization.
