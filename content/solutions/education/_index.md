Education AI applications address two structural challenges: the resource constraint (one teacher to many students limits personalized attention) and the measurement gap (high-stakes assessments provide infrequent snapshots rather than continuous learning signals). AI systems that can provide individualized feedback at scale — and surface early signals of disengagement or struggle — address both. The field draws on decades of research in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), beginning with Bloom's 1984 "2 Sigma Problem" demonstrating that one-on-one tutoring produces two standard deviations of improvement over classroom instruction. AI now makes approximations of that tutoring ratio achievable at population scale. Deployment in schools operates under student data privacy obligations: FERPA (US), COPPA for under-13 data (US), and GDPR (EU).

## Solution Areas

**[AI Tutor](ai-tutor/)** — Provide students with Socratic dialogue, hints, and worked examples in response to questions and errors. LLM-based tutors adapt explanation style to student responses, unlike static instructional content. Research on intelligent tutoring systems (VanLehn, 2011, *Educational Psychologist*) shows effect sizes of 0.76 for ITS vs. classroom instruction — approaching Bloom's two-sigma benchmark.

**[AI Tutoring](ai-tutoring/)** — Structured tutoring session management: practice problem generation, spaced repetition scheduling, and mastery gating before advancing to new material. Combines LLM conversational capability with knowledge component models (BKT, PFA) that track skill acquisition at granular levels.

**[Automated Grading](automated-grading/)** — Score open-ended written responses, short answers, and coding assignments using NLP models. Automated Essay Scoring (AES) systems have been validated for consistency with human raters on standardized assessments (e-rater, Turnitin). Frees instructor time for feedback on complex or ambiguous responses that benefit from human judgment.

**[Curriculum Personalization](curriculum-personalization/)** — Adapt the sequence and difficulty of content to each learner's demonstrated knowledge state. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) models (Corbett & Anderson, 1994) estimate skill mastery from response histories; modern deep knowledge tracing (DKT, Piech et al. 2015) scales this to thousands of skills using LSTM architectures. Content recommendations adjust in real time as students demonstrate mastery or struggle.

**[Learning Path Optimization](learning-path-optimization/)** — Recommend the next activity, module, or resource for each student based on learning goals, time available, and knowledge state. Reinforcement learning approaches (Mandel et al., 2014) learn policies that maximize long-term learning outcomes rather than immediate engagement — an important distinction from engagement-optimized content recommendation.

**[Student Analytics](student-analytics/)** — Aggregate learning management system (LMS) data, assessment results, and engagement signals to identify at-risk students early. Early alert models give instructors and advisors actionable signals weeks before a student is at risk of failing or dropping. Particularly impactful in higher education, where retention rates drive institutional financial health.

**[Plagiarism Detection](plagiarism-detection/)** — Identify academic integrity violations in submitted work using similarity detection, stylometric analysis, and AI-generated text classification. The emergence of LLM-generated text (post-2022) has substantially complicated this space — detection of AI-written content remains an active research problem with high false positive rates (Weber-Wulff et al., 2023, *International Journal of Educational Integrity*).
