description: "AI applications for healthcare organizations: medical imaging, diagnostics, clinical data analysis, patient triage, health monitoring, and drug discovery."

Healthcare AI deployments operate under constraints that differ from most enterprise AI work. Clinical decisions carry patient safety implications, data is governed by HIPAA and GDPR, and AI systems used in diagnostic or treatment decisions may be regulated as medical devices under FDA 510(k) or EU MDR. The strongest applications reduce administrative burden and augment clinician judgment rather than replacing it.

## Solution Areas

**[Medical Imaging](medical-imaging/)** — Detect anomalies in radiology images (X-ray, CT, MRI, histopathology slides) using computer vision models. Proven use cases include diabetic retinopathy screening, chest X-ray triage, and skin lesion classification. Models flag priority cases and pre-annotate findings for radiologist confirmation.

**[Radiology AI](radiology-ai/)** — Dedicated pipeline for integrating AI into PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) workflows: DICOM preprocessing, inference at scale, worklist prioritization, and structured report generation with AI-assisted findings.

**[Clinical Data Analysis](clinical-data/)** — Extract insights from structured (EHR tables, lab results, vitals) and unstructured (clinical notes, discharge summaries) patient data. NLP models identify diagnoses, medications, and procedures from free text. Predictive models flag patients at risk of readmission, deterioration, or sepsis.

**[Patient Triage](patient-triage/)** — Route incoming patients to appropriate care levels using symptom data, medical history, and acuity scoring. AI surfaces risk indicators from intake data, reducing time-to-treatment for high-acuity cases.

**[Appointment Scheduling](appointment-scheduling/)** — Predict no-show probability and proactively fill cancellation slots. Optimize scheduling to match patient complexity with provider availability, reducing idle time and wait lists.

**[Health Monitoring](health-monitoring/)** — Analyze continuous wearable and remote monitoring data (ECG, SpO₂, glucose, activity) to detect anomalies and alert care teams. Edge inference on device reduces latency; cloud aggregation enables population-level trend analysis.

**[Drug Discovery](drug-discovery/)** — Apply ML to molecular property prediction, candidate screening, and clinical trial design. Transformer models trained on molecular sequences predict binding affinity, toxicity, and bioavailability, narrowing the experimental search space.
