Medical imaging generates more data than radiologists and pathologists can review at current staffing levels. In many European healthcare systems, radiology reporting backlogs have reached 4-8 weeks for non-urgent studies. AI is being deployed as a clinical decision support tool - not to replace radiologists, but to help them work through higher volumes with consistent quality, and to prioritize critical findings for urgent review.

## Radiology Assistance

AI radiology assistance tools work in two modes: detection and prioritization.

**Detection** - Computer-aided detection (CAD) algorithms highlight findings of interest in imaging studies. Well-validated examples include pulmonary nodule detection in CT scans, bone fracture detection in X-rays, and intracranial hemorrhage detection in CT heads. These models are trained on millions of annotated studies and achieve sensitivity comparable to or exceeding individual radiologists for specific finding types.

**Prioritization** - For time-critical findings (intracranial hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism), AI triage tools re-order the reporting queue to surface urgent studies regardless of when they were scanned. A study with an AI-detected critical finding moves to the top of the queue even if it arrived at 2am and the next study came in two hours later.

## Pathology Screening

Digital pathology creates high-resolution images of tissue slides that AI can analyze at scale. Primary applications:

- Prostate cancer grading (Gleason scoring) with AI assistance reduces inter-pathologist variability
- Breast cancer detection in mammography and histology screening
- Cervical cancer screening from liquid biopsy preparations

Pathology AI works best as a second read - the AI flags areas of interest and pathologists concentrate review time on those regions.

## Imaging Quality Assessment

Poor-quality images generate poor-quality AI analysis - and poor-quality human reads too. Automated quality assessment at the point of acquisition can prompt for rescan immediately, rather than discovering a non-diagnostic study hours or days later. Quality checks include patient positioning, exposure parameters, motion artifacts, and equipment-related artifacts.

Quality assessment models are simpler to develop and validate than diagnostic models, and the value is immediate: reducing rescan rates and preventing non-diagnostic studies from reaching the reporting queue.

## Regulatory and Clinical Governance

Medical AI in Europe operates under the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the AI Act. Software that influences clinical decisions qualifies as a medical device and requires CE marking. The regulatory pathway is significant: clinical validation studies, post-market surveillance, and documentation requirements add 12-24 months and 500,000-1,500,000 EUR to development timelines for Class IIa and IIb devices.

For healthcare organizations deploying third-party AI tools, due diligence on CE marking status is essential. For those developing internal tools, the regulatory pathway needs to be understood before investment decisions are made. AI used purely for workflow management (prioritization, not diagnosis) may qualify under lower-risk classifications.

Clinical governance requirements remain regardless of regulatory classification: model validation on local data, monitoring for performance drift, clear protocols for when AI output should be overridden, and training for clinical users.
