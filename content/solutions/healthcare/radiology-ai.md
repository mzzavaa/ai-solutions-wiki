Radiology workloads have grown dramatically as imaging becomes more accessible and clinical indications expand. Radiologists in many European healthcare systems read 50-100 studies per day, with increasing study complexity (more slices per CT, more sequences per MRI). AI radiology tools assist radiologists by automating detection of specific findings, performing quantitative measurements, and generating structured preliminary reports.

## The Problem

Radiologist fatigue and volume pressure create conditions for diagnostic errors. Studies show that 3-5% of significant findings are missed on initial read, with the rate increasing during high-volume periods and overnight shifts. Quantitative measurements (tumor volumes, vessel diameters, organ sizes) are time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. Structured reporting is encouraged by clinical guidelines but adds time to the reporting workflow.

The radiology workforce shortage compounds these challenges. Training a radiologist takes 10-13 years, and the supply of new radiologists is not keeping pace with imaging volume growth. AI tools that improve per-radiologist productivity are essential for sustainable imaging services.

## AI Approach

**Automated detection** - SageMaker hosts computer vision models trained to detect specific findings: pulmonary nodules, fractures, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, aortic aneurysm, and breast lesions. These models process imaging studies in the background and annotate findings for radiologist review. Detection performance varies by finding type but typically achieves sensitivity of 90-98% with specificity of 85-95%.

**Quantitative analysis** - AI performs automated measurements that would otherwise require manual annotation: tumor volume and change over time, cardiac chamber dimensions, liver fat fraction, bone density, and vessel stenosis grading. Automated quantification reduces measurement variability and frees radiologist time for interpretive work.

**Structured reporting** - Bedrock generates structured preliminary reports from the AI detection and quantification outputs, formatted according to institutional and specialty reporting standards (e.g., BI-RADS for breast imaging, Lung-RADS for lung cancer screening). The radiologist reviews, edits, and signs the report rather than dictating from scratch.

**Triage and prioritization** - Studies with AI-detected critical findings (intracranial hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, aortic dissection) are automatically elevated in the reading queue. This reduces the time to reporting for time-sensitive findings from hours to minutes.

## Architecture

Imaging studies flow from PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) to the AI pipeline via DICOM messaging. S3 stores the imaging data for processing. SageMaker endpoints run inference on each study, with findings stored in DynamoDB. Results are pushed back to PACS as structured annotations and to the radiology information system (RIS) for worklist prioritization. Bedrock generates preliminary reports that appear in the radiologist's reporting workflow.

## Key Considerations

**Regulatory requirements** - AI radiology tools used in clinical practice are medical devices requiring CE marking under the EU MDR. The regulatory pathway includes clinical validation, post-market surveillance, and quality management system requirements. This is not optional and adds significant time and cost to deployment.

**Integration standards** - Healthcare imaging systems use DICOM for image exchange and HL7/FHIR for clinical data. AI tools must integrate with existing PACS, RIS, and EHR infrastructure through these standards rather than requiring workflow changes.

**Validation on local data** - Model performance demonstrated on training data or published benchmarks may not transfer to local data. Differences in equipment, patient demographics, scan protocols, and disease prevalence require local validation before clinical deployment.

**Cross-referencing** - Radiology AI extends the medical imaging solutions already in this wiki. It connects to patient triage (imaging findings inform triage decisions), health monitoring (monitoring may trigger imaging requests), and drug discovery (imaging biomarkers for trial endpoints).

## Next Steps

Identify the highest-impact use case based on local needs: high-volume finding types with significant miss rates or quantitative tasks that consume disproportionate radiologist time. Evaluate available CE-marked AI tools for that use case. Conduct a local validation study comparing AI performance against radiologist reads on a representative sample of local studies before clinical deployment.
