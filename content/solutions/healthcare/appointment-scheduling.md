Healthcare scheduling is a complex optimization problem: matching patient demand to provider capacity while accounting for appointment types, provider specialties, equipment requirements, patient preferences, and urgency levels. Poor scheduling leads to provider idle time (unfilled slots), patient access delays (long wait times for appointments), and no-shows (wasted capacity). AI scheduling optimizes all three dimensions simultaneously.

## The Problem

Healthcare no-show rates range from 15% to 30% depending on the specialty and patient population. Each no-show wastes a slot that could have served another patient, directly reducing system throughput. Overbooking to compensate for no-shows creates unpredictable workloads and patient wait times when more patients arrive than expected.

Scheduling rules are typically simple and static: 15-minute slots for follow-ups, 30 minutes for new patients. These rules do not account for the actual complexity of individual appointments, leading to some appointments running over (creating cascading delays) and others finishing early (creating idle time).

## AI Approach

**No-show prediction** - SageMaker models predict the probability that each scheduled patient will not attend, based on historical attendance patterns, appointment characteristics (lead time, time of day, day of week), patient demographics, weather forecasts, and recent engagement signals (portal logins, reminder responses). Patients with high no-show probability receive targeted interventions: reminder calls, transportation assistance, or waitlist backfill.

**Dynamic overbooking** - Rather than a fixed overbooking percentage, the system calculates the optimal number of appointments per slot based on the aggregate no-show probability of scheduled patients. If a slot contains patients with high predicted attendance, no overbooking is needed. If scheduled patients have high no-show probability, the system books additional patients from the waitlist.

**Appointment duration prediction** - The model predicts the actual duration of each appointment based on patient complexity, reason for visit, provider practice patterns, and historical visit durations. This enables flexible slot sizing: complex patients receive longer slots and simple follow-ups receive shorter slots, improving both provider utilization and schedule accuracy.

**Intelligent waitlist management** - Bedrock powers a patient communication system that offers newly available slots to waitlisted patients matched by urgency, availability, and appropriateness. DynamoDB maintains real-time slot availability and waitlist state.

## Architecture

The scheduling system integrates with the EHR and practice management system via HL7 FHIR or proprietary APIs. SageMaker models run nightly batch predictions (no-show probability, duration estimates) and near-real-time predictions for same-day scheduling changes. Lambda functions handle waitlist matching and patient notification. DynamoDB stores schedule state for real-time operations.

## Key Considerations

**Patient equity** - Scheduling optimization must not disadvantage certain patient populations. If no-show prediction correlates with socioeconomic factors, overbooking decisions based on these predictions could create longer waits for disadvantaged patients. Fairness constraints must be explicit in the optimization.

**Provider preferences** - Providers have legitimate scheduling preferences (buffer time between complex cases, preferred start times, teaching time). The optimization must respect these constraints while maximizing throughput.

**System integration** - Healthcare scheduling involves multiple interconnected systems (EHR, practice management, patient portal, communication platforms). API reliability and data consistency across systems are operational prerequisites.

**Cross-referencing** - Appointment scheduling connects to patient triage (urgency-based scheduling), health monitoring (proactive scheduling based on remote monitoring alerts), and shares optimization patterns with production scheduling in manufacturing.

## Next Steps

Analyze historical no-show patterns to build the prediction model. Validate against held-out data, then pilot targeted interventions (additional reminders, transportation offers) for high-probability no-show patients. Measure the no-show rate reduction and throughput improvement before deploying dynamic overbooking.
