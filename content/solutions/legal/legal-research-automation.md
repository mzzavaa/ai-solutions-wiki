Legal research is foundational to legal practice but extraordinarily time-consuming. A lawyer researching a novel legal question may spend 10-20 hours searching case law databases, reading judgments, and synthesizing relevant precedent. AI legal research tools accelerate this process by combining semantic search with analytical summarization, reducing research time while expanding the scope of sources considered.

## The Problem

Traditional legal research relies on keyword search across case law databases. Keyword search misses relevant cases that discuss the same legal concept using different terminology. It also returns high volumes of marginally relevant results that require manual review. Junior lawyers developing research memos often lack the experience to identify which precedents are most authoritative or to recognize when a line of authority has been overruled or distinguished.

The volume of published legal material compounds the problem. Courts across Europe publish thousands of new judgments annually. Keeping current with relevant developments across multiple jurisdictions is impractical through manual monitoring alone.

## AI Approach

**Semantic search** - Legal documents are embedded using domain-specific models fine-tuned on legal corpora. Amazon OpenSearch with vector search capability enables retrieval based on legal concepts rather than exact keywords. A query about "employer liability for contractor negligence" retrieves relevant cases even if they use terms like "vicarious liability," "principal-agent relationship," or "non-delegable duty."

**Citation graph analysis** - SageMaker models analyze the citation network between cases to identify authoritative precedent. Cases cited frequently by subsequent courts carry more weight. Cases that have been distinguished, overruled, or criticized are flagged with their current status.

**Research synthesis** - Bedrock generates structured research memos that summarize the relevant legal principles, identify the leading authorities, note jurisdictional variations, and highlight unresolved questions. Each statement is linked to its source case for verification.

**Monitoring and alerts** - Ongoing monitoring of new judgments and legislation triggers alerts when new material is relevant to active matters or areas of practice. Relevance is determined by semantic similarity to the firm's defined areas of interest.

## Architecture

Legal source materials (case law, statutes, regulatory guidance) are ingested into S3 and processed through an embedding pipeline on SageMaker. Embeddings are indexed in OpenSearch. Research queries are processed through Bedrock, which generates search queries, retrieves relevant documents, and synthesizes findings. The citation graph is maintained in Neptune for network analysis. Results are delivered through a web application fronted by CloudFront.

## Key Considerations

**Hallucination risk** - Legal research demands precision. AI-generated case citations must be verifiable. The system should only cite cases present in the indexed corpus, and every citation should link to the source document. Hallucinated case names or incorrect holdings are professionally dangerous.

**Jurisdictional boundaries** - Legal research must respect jurisdictional hierarchy. A decision of the German Federal Court of Justice has different authority than a regional court decision. The system must understand and communicate these distinctions.

**Currency** - Legal authority changes. Cases are overruled, statutes are amended, and regulatory guidance evolves. The system must maintain current status information and flag when cited authority may be outdated.

**Professional responsibility** - AI-generated research outputs are tools for lawyers, not substitutes for legal judgment. The lawyer remains responsible for verifying AI outputs and exercising professional judgment about their application to the specific matter.

## Next Steps

Begin by indexing the jurisdiction's primary case law database and building the semantic search layer. Validate retrieval quality against research questions with known answers. Deploy to a pilot group of researchers with explicit verification requirements. Measure time savings and research quality against manual benchmarks before broader rollout.
