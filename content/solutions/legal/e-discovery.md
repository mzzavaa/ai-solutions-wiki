Electronic discovery (e-discovery) is the process of identifying, collecting, processing, reviewing, and producing electronically stored information (ESI) in legal proceedings. The exponential growth of digital data - email, chat messages, cloud documents, collaboration platforms - has made e-discovery one of the most expensive and complex aspects of modern litigation. AI transforms each stage of the e-discovery lifecycle, reducing costs and timelines while improving accuracy.

## The Problem

Organizations generate vast volumes of ESI across dozens of platforms: email systems, Slack and Teams channels, SharePoint sites, cloud storage, databases, and mobile devices. When litigation or a regulatory investigation arises, the organization must identify and preserve relevant data, collect it defensibly, process it into reviewable format, review it for relevance and privilege, and produce responsive documents to the opposing party or regulator.

Each stage presents challenges. Data identification requires understanding where relevant information resides across the organization's technology landscape. Collection must preserve metadata and chain of custody. Processing must handle hundreds of file types and extract text from images and attachments. Review is the most expensive stage, often consuming 70% of total e-discovery costs.

## AI Approach

**Intelligent data mapping** - Bedrock analyzes the legal matter's scope (parties, date ranges, topics) against the organization's data map to recommend custodians and data sources likely to contain relevant information. This replaces the traditional approach of broad collection followed by expensive culling.

**Automated processing** - Textract extracts text from scanned documents, images, and complex file formats. Lambda functions handle format normalization, metadata extraction, de-duplication, and email threading. The processing pipeline runs on S3 with parallel processing for high throughput.

**Early case assessment (ECA)** - Before full review, AI analyzes the processed document population to provide a rapid assessment: estimated volume of relevant documents, key topics and custodians, date distribution, and potential privilege issues. This enables informed decisions about litigation strategy and review budgeting.

**Predictive coding for review** - SageMaker models classify documents as relevant or non-relevant based on a training set coded by subject matter experts. The model scores the entire population, allowing the review team to focus on likely-relevant documents and validate the non-relevant set through statistical sampling.

**Production automation** - Once review is complete, the production pipeline applies redactions (Bedrock identifies redactable content such as personally identifiable information), applies Bates numbering, converts to production format (typically TIFF or PDF), and generates load files compatible with the opposing party's review platform.

## Architecture

Data is collected from source systems via API integrations and forensic collection tools into S3. A Step Functions workflow orchestrates the processing pipeline: text extraction, metadata normalization, de-duplication, and indexing into OpenSearch. The review platform queries OpenSearch for search and retrieval, with SageMaker providing predictive coding scores. Production workflows in Step Functions handle format conversion, redaction, and load file generation.

## Key Considerations

**Defensibility and proportionality** - E-discovery processes must withstand judicial scrutiny. Documentation of methodology, validation of AI-assisted review through statistical sampling, and proportionality of effort to the matter's significance are all requirements.

**Data privacy** - Cross-border e-discovery must comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, national privacy laws). Data transfer mechanisms, processing agreements, and privacy impact assessments are prerequisites for handling personal data in discovery.

**Preservation obligations** - Legal hold requirements mandate preservation of potentially relevant data from the moment litigation is reasonably anticipated. Automated legal hold processes ensure compliance and reduce spoliation risk.

**Cost predictability** - AI-driven e-discovery enables more predictable cost modeling. Early case assessment provides data-driven estimates that replace the traditional uncertainty around review costs.

## Next Steps

Assess the organization's current e-discovery maturity: data mapping completeness, collection capabilities, and review platform infrastructure. Identify the highest-cost stage (usually review) and pilot AI-assisted approaches on the next suitable matter. Build defensibility documentation from the outset to support the methodology in court if challenged.
