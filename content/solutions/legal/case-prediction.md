Litigation involves significant uncertainty. Lawyers advise clients on the likely outcome of disputes based on experience and judgment, but this assessment is inherently subjective and difficult to calibrate across a broad portfolio of cases. AI case prediction models provide data-driven probability estimates for case outcomes, helping law firms and legal departments make more informed decisions about litigation strategy, settlement, and resource allocation.

## The Problem

Legal departments managing large litigation portfolios - insurance defense, employment disputes, commercial claims - need to allocate resources efficiently and set accurate reserves. Over-optimistic assessments lead to under-reserving and surprise losses. Over-pessimistic assessments lead to unnecessary settlements and inflated reserves that tie up capital.

Individual case assessment relies on the assigning lawyer's experience, which varies. A firm handling 500 employment disputes per year benefits from aggregate pattern recognition that no individual lawyer can replicate from personal experience alone.

## AI Approach

**Feature extraction** - SageMaker models analyze case characteristics that predict outcomes: claim type, jurisdiction, judge assignment, party characteristics, claim value, legal theories alleged, and procedural history. For courts that publish decisions, historical outcome data provides training labels. Bedrock extracts structured features from unstructured case filings and pleadings.

**Outcome prediction** - Classification models predict binary outcomes (plaintiff win/defendant win) and regression models predict settlement amounts and case duration. Ensemble methods combining gradient boosted trees with neural networks typically outperform single-model approaches. Models are trained separately for distinct case categories (employment, commercial, personal injury) because the predictive features differ substantially.

**Judge analytics** - Where judicial assignment is known, judge-specific outcome patterns provide a strong predictive signal. Some judges grant summary judgment at significantly higher rates than peers; some favor certain legal theories. These patterns are extracted from published decisions and incorporated as model features.

**Portfolio analytics** - Redshift aggregates case-level predictions into portfolio views: total expected exposure, probability-weighted reserve recommendations, and identification of outlier cases that deserve disproportionate attention.

## Architecture

Case data is extracted from the case management system into Redshift. SageMaker training pipelines run monthly on updated historical data. Bedrock processes new case filings to extract features for prediction. Prediction results are stored in DynamoDB and surfaced through the case management system integration and QuickSight dashboards for portfolio analytics.

## Key Considerations

**Data quality and availability** - Prediction quality depends on historical outcome data. Jurisdictions that publish comprehensive decision databases enable better models than those with limited public records. Settlement data, which is often confidential, is particularly valuable but hard to obtain outside the organization's own portfolio.

**Ethical boundaries** - Case prediction should inform strategy, not determine it. Predictions based on judge identity or party demographics raise ethical questions about reinforcing systemic biases. Model features should be scrutinized for fairness implications.

**Calibration over accuracy** - A model that says "70% probability of defendant win" should be correct 70% of the time across all cases receiving that score. Well-calibrated probability estimates are more useful for decision-making than high accuracy on a binary prediction.

**Transparency** - Lawyers need to understand why a prediction was made. Feature importance explanations (which factors drive the prediction for this case) enable informed judgment about whether the model's reasoning is sound for the specific situation.

## Next Steps

Start with a homogeneous case type where the firm has substantial historical data (e.g., employment discrimination claims in a specific jurisdiction). Build a retrospective model and validate against held-out historical cases. If calibration is adequate, pilot with a litigation team that uses predictions alongside their own assessments, comparing decision quality over a 12-month period.
