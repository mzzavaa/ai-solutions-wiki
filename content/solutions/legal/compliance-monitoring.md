Regulatory environments are increasingly complex and dynamic. A multinational financial services firm may be subject to regulations from dozens of authorities across multiple jurisdictions. Tracking regulatory changes, assessing their impact on existing policies and procedures, and ensuring timely compliance is a significant operational burden. AI compliance monitoring automates the detection, analysis, and triaging of regulatory changes.

## The Problem

Regulatory change volumes have increased dramatically. The average financial institution tracks 200+ regulatory bodies and processes 50,000+ regulatory updates annually. Compliance teams manually review these updates to identify which are relevant, assess their impact on the organization, and determine what policy or process changes are required. The manual process is slow, inconsistent, and prone to gaps - particularly for cross-jurisdictional requirements where similar regulations emerge across multiple authorities.

## AI Approach

**Regulatory feed ingestion** - Automated crawlers collect regulatory publications, consultation papers, guidance notes, and enforcement actions from relevant authorities. Lambda functions process these feeds daily, extracting structured metadata (authority, date, topic, jurisdiction) and full text for analysis.

**Relevance classification** - Bedrock classifies each regulatory update against the organization's regulatory inventory - a structured catalog of applicable regulations. The model determines whether an update is relevant (affects an applicable regulation), potentially relevant (requires human assessment), or not relevant (outside the organization's scope). This reduces the volume requiring human review by 70-80%.

**Impact assessment** - For relevant updates, the system maps the regulatory change to affected internal policies, procedures, and controls. OpenSearch indexes the organization's policy framework, enabling semantic matching between regulatory requirements and internal documents. The output identifies which policies need updating and estimates the scope of required changes.

**Gap analysis** - Periodic comprehensive scans compare the full regulatory inventory against the organization's current compliance state, identifying gaps where requirements exist but corresponding controls or policies are missing or outdated.

## Architecture

Regulatory source feeds are ingested via Lambda functions into S3. Bedrock processes each update through the relevance and impact assessment pipeline. Results are stored in DynamoDB and surfaced through a compliance dashboard. OpenSearch maintains the searchable index of both regulatory requirements and internal policies. Step Functions orchestrates the end-to-end workflow, including escalation routing for high-impact changes.

## Key Considerations

**Regulatory interpretation** - Regulations require interpretation, and reasonable people disagree about the implications of ambiguous language. AI analysis should highlight ambiguity rather than resolve it, flagging provisions where multiple interpretations are plausible.

**Organizational context** - Impact assessment depends on understanding the organization's specific business activities, products, and geographic footprint. The system must be configured with this context to produce relevant assessments rather than generic summaries.

**Accountability** - Compliance is a legal obligation. AI outputs inform human decision-making but do not transfer accountability. Every compliance determination should be reviewed and approved by a qualified compliance professional.

**Cross-referencing** - Regulatory requirements across industries like finance and healthcare often overlap. The system should cross-reference related solution domains such as anti-money-laundering in finance and fraud detection in insurance to provide holistic compliance views.

## Next Steps

Catalog the organization's current regulatory inventory and identify the highest-volume regulatory sources. Build the ingestion pipeline for those sources first. Deploy relevance classification in shadow mode alongside the existing manual triage process to validate accuracy. Expand to impact assessment once relevance classification accuracy exceeds 90%.
