Contract review is one of the most time-intensive tasks in legal practice. A typical M&A transaction involves reviewing thousands of contracts to identify risks, obligations, and non-standard terms. Junior lawyers spend 60-80% of their time on document review tasks that are repetitive but require careful attention. AI contract analysis reduces review time by 60-80% while improving consistency and reducing missed clauses.

## The Problem

Large organizations maintain portfolios of thousands to tens of thousands of active contracts. These contracts contain obligations (payment terms, renewal dates, performance commitments), risks (liability caps, indemnification terms, change of control provisions), and non-standard deviations from template language. Manual review of this volume is impractical for routine contract management, and expensive when triggered by events like M&A due diligence, regulatory changes, or portfolio-wide risk assessments.

The specific challenges include: extracting structured data from unstructured legal text, identifying clauses that deviate from standard terms, flagging missing provisions that should be present, and tracking obligations across contract lifecycles.

## AI Approach

**Document extraction** - Amazon Textract processes scanned contracts and PDFs to extract text with layout preservation. For digitally-native documents, direct text extraction maintains formatting context that aids clause identification.

**Clause identification and classification** - Bedrock analyzes contract text to identify and classify standard clause types: limitation of liability, indemnification, termination, governing law, assignment, force majeure, confidentiality, and intellectual property. The model maps each clause to a standardized taxonomy and extracts key parameters (dates, amounts, parties, conditions).

**Risk scoring** - Each contract receives a risk score based on deviations from the organization's standard terms. A limitation of liability clause capped at 1x contract value scores differently than one with unlimited liability. Missing standard clauses (e.g., no data protection provision in a technology contract) are flagged as gaps. Risk scores are calibrated against the organization's risk appetite and the contract's commercial context.

**Obligation extraction** - The system extracts time-bound obligations (renewal notice periods, reporting requirements, milestone dates) and populates a structured obligation register. This register feeds into calendar-based alerts for upcoming deadlines.

## Architecture

Contracts are uploaded to S3 from the contract management system or document repository. A Step Functions workflow orchestrates the analysis pipeline: Textract for text extraction, Bedrock for clause analysis and risk scoring, and DynamoDB for storing structured outputs. Results are exposed via API Gateway to the contract management platform. QuickSight dashboards provide portfolio-level views of risk distribution, obligation timelines, and non-standard terms.

## Key Considerations

**Jurisdiction sensitivity** - Contract interpretation varies by governing law. A "best efforts" obligation means different things under English law versus German law. The analysis must account for jurisdiction-specific interpretation standards.

**Confidence thresholds** - High-stakes contract provisions (indemnification, liability) require higher confidence thresholds than low-stakes administrative clauses. Route low-confidence extractions to human review.

**Template comparison** - The most practical deployment compares new contracts against the organization's approved templates, highlighting deviations. This is more actionable than open-ended contract analysis and easier to validate.

**Audit trail** - Legal work requires traceability. Every AI-generated analysis should reference the specific contract text that supports each finding, enabling rapid human verification.

## Next Steps

Start with a well-defined use case: reviewing incoming vendor contracts against standard terms, or extracting obligations from an existing contract portfolio. Define the clause taxonomy and risk criteria before building the AI pipeline. Validate against a set of contracts that have been recently reviewed by lawyers to establish accuracy benchmarks.
