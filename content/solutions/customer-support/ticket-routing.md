Support ticket routing determines how quickly and effectively customer issues are resolved. Manual routing relies on customers selecting categories (often incorrectly) or frontline agents triaging tickets (adding delay and cost). Misrouted tickets bounce between teams, increasing resolution time and customer frustration. AI routing classifies tickets accurately, assigns priority based on content analysis, and routes to the agent or team best equipped to resolve the issue.

## The Problem

Large support organizations handle thousands of tickets daily across dozens of categories and teams. Manual triage creates a bottleneck: each ticket must be read, classified, prioritized, and assigned before resolution work begins. Triage accuracy depends on the triaging agent's knowledge of all team capabilities and current workloads.

Misrouting rates of 15-30% are common. Each misroute adds an average of 4-8 hours to resolution time as the ticket transfers between teams. Customers whose tickets are misrouted multiple times are significantly more likely to escalate or churn.

## AI Approach

**Content classification** - Amazon Comprehend and SageMaker models classify tickets by issue type, product area, and technical complexity based on the ticket content, subject line, and any attached data. NLP models trained on historical tickets with resolved categories achieve classification accuracy of 85-95%, significantly exceeding customer self-categorization.

**Priority prediction** - Bedrock analyzes ticket content to assess urgency and business impact. Factors include: explicit urgency language, number of affected users, revenue impact indicators, compliance implications, and customer segment (enterprise vs. individual). Priority assignment replaces subjective agent judgment with consistent, policy-aligned assessment.

**Skill-based routing** - The system matches ticket requirements (language, product expertise, technical depth, customer tier) against agent capabilities and current availability. SageMaker models predict which agent is most likely to resolve the ticket in a single interaction based on their historical performance with similar issues.

**Workload balancing** - Routing considers real-time team workloads and queue depths. When one team is overloaded while a similar team has capacity, the system routes to the available team. This dynamic balancing reduces wait times and evens workload distribution.

## Architecture

Tickets arrive from multiple channels (email, web form, chat, phone) into the ticketing system. Comprehend and SageMaker process ticket content for classification and priority scoring. Lambda functions apply routing logic based on classification, priority, agent skills, and workload. Routed tickets are assigned in the ticketing system via API. Routing accuracy and resolution metrics are tracked in QuickSight dashboards.

## Key Considerations

**Continuous improvement** - Agent reclassifications and routing corrections feed back into model retraining. The model improves as agents correct misclassifications, but only if the feedback loop is functional and agents consistently correct errors.

**Transparency** - Agents should see why a ticket was routed to them (classification reason, matched skills) to build trust in the system and provide correction when routing is wrong.

**Escalation paths** - Automated routing must include clear escalation paths for urgent issues that need immediate human attention. Critical tickets should bypass normal queue processing.

**Cross-referencing** - Ticket routing connects to sentiment detection (prioritizing negative-sentiment tickets), knowledge base automation (deflecting tickets that can be self-served), and quality monitoring (measuring routing accuracy impact on resolution quality).

## Next Steps

Analyze historical ticket data to identify classification categories and routing rules. Build the classification model on tickets with validated resolution categories. Pilot automated routing for one product area or team, measuring routing accuracy, resolution time, and first-contact resolution rate against the manual routing baseline.
