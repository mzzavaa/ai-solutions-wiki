Customer support AI addresses a fundamental scaling problem: support volume grows with the customer base, but hiring scales linearly while costs compound. AI intervenes at three points in the support lifecycle: deflection (handling contacts before they reach an agent), triage (routing contacts to the right resource), and augmentation (helping agents resolve contacts faster). Gartner estimates that 80% of customer interactions will be handled by AI by 2029, up from 20% in 2023. The shift from keyword-rule chatbots to LLM-powered assistants is the primary driver — large language models handle the long tail of queries that scripted systems cannot.

## Solution Areas

**[AI Chatbot](ai-chatbot/)** — Handle inbound customer queries through natural language conversation across web, mobile, and messaging channels. LLM-powered chatbots with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over product documentation and policy knowledge resolve common queries without agent involvement. Escalation to human agents on failure or frustration detection is a required design component — not an afterthought.

**[Ticket Routing](ticket-routing/)** — Classify and route incoming support tickets to the correct team, queue, or agent using NLP models trained on historical routing decisions. Reduces misroute rates and the reassignment loops that inflate handle time. Multi-label classification handles tickets that span multiple issue types.

**[Sentiment Detection](sentiment-detection/)** — Analyze customer message sentiment in real time to detect frustration, urgency, and churn signals. Alerts supervisors to escalating interactions and triggers priority handling for at-risk customers. Post-interaction sentiment scoring provides a scalable alternative to customer satisfaction surveys, which suffer from low response rates and selection bias.

**[Self-Service Automation](self-service-automation/)** — Automate high-volume transactional requests (order status, password reset, return initiation, appointment booking) without agent involvement. Integrates with backend systems via API to execute transactions directly from the conversational interface. Containment rate (contacts resolved without agent transfer) is the primary KPI.

**[Knowledge Base Automation](knowledge-base-automation/)** — Generate, maintain, and surface support documentation using AI. LLMs draft knowledge base articles from resolved ticket content; semantic search surfaces the most relevant article for each inbound query. Reduces agent research time and ensures documentation stays current as products change.

**[Quality Monitoring](quality-monitoring/)** — Score 100% of agent interactions against quality rubrics using speech-to-text and NLP — replacing the 1–3% sample-based scoring typical of manual QA. Models evaluate compliance adherence, empathy, resolution accuracy, and script adherence. Provides coaching triggers and identifies systematic training gaps across the team.
