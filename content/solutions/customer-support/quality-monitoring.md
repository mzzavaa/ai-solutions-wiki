Quality monitoring ensures that customer support interactions meet service standards, compliance requirements, and customer expectations. Traditional QA processes sample 2-5% of interactions for manual review - a statistically inadequate sample that misses the vast majority of quality issues. AI quality monitoring evaluates 100% of interactions against defined criteria, providing comprehensive quality visibility and targeted coaching opportunities.

## The Problem

Manual QA is limited by reviewer capacity. A QA analyst reviewing interactions at a rate of 5-10 per hour can cover only a fraction of an agent's weekly output. The sample is typically random or complaint-driven, missing systemic quality issues that affect the majority of interactions. Agents may perform well on sampled interactions (knowing they are reviewed) while delivering lower quality on unmonitored ones.

Inconsistency between QA reviewers is also a challenge. Different reviewers score the same interaction differently, creating perceived unfairness and undermining the coaching process. QA reviewer calibration sessions help but do not eliminate variability.

## AI Approach

**Automated scorecard evaluation** - Bedrock evaluates each interaction against the organization's QA scorecard. The scorecard includes criteria like: greeting and identification, problem understanding, technical accuracy, resolution completeness, compliance disclosures, upsell appropriateness, and closing. Each criterion is scored based on the interaction content, producing a comprehensive quality score for every interaction.

**Compliance monitoring** - Specific compliance requirements (data protection disclosures, financial advice disclaimers, identity verification procedures) are checked automatically. Non-compliant interactions are flagged immediately for supervisor review, regardless of overall quality score.

**Voice quality analysis** - Amazon Transcribe converts phone interactions to text for analysis. Additional models evaluate voice-specific quality dimensions: speaking clarity, pace, empathy indicators, and active listening signals.

**Coaching opportunity identification** - SageMaker models analyze quality scores across agents, time periods, and interaction types to identify coaching priorities. Rather than reviewing random interactions, coaches receive targeted recommendations: "Agent X scores consistently low on problem understanding for product Y - review these 3 specific interactions."

## Architecture

Interactions are captured from all channels: chat transcripts, email threads, and voice recordings transcribed by Transcribe. Bedrock evaluates each interaction against the QA scorecard. Results are stored in DynamoDB and aggregated in Redshift. QuickSight dashboards provide quality metrics at agent, team, and organizational levels. Coaching recommendations are delivered to supervisors through the workforce management interface.

## Key Considerations

**Scorecard design** - AI QA is only as good as the scorecard it evaluates against. Criteria must be specific, observable, and consistently interpretable. Vague criteria ("showed empathy") produce inconsistent AI scores just as they produce inconsistent human scores.

**Calibration** - AI quality scores should be regularly calibrated against expert human reviewers. A sample of interactions should be scored by both AI and experienced QA analysts, with discrepancies investigated and the AI model adjusted.

**Agent acceptance** - Agents may resist comprehensive monitoring. Transparency about what is evaluated, how scores are used (coaching vs. punitive), and access to their own scores builds acceptance. Position AI QA as a tool that provides consistent, objective feedback.

**Cross-referencing** - Quality monitoring connects to sentiment detection (quality impacts sentiment), knowledge base automation (quality issues may indicate knowledge gaps), and ticket routing (quality varies by routing accuracy).

## Next Steps

Define the QA scorecard with specific, measurable criteria. Score a calibration set of 200+ interactions with both AI and expert human reviewers. Measure agreement rates and calibrate the AI scoring. Deploy automated scoring for all interactions, delivering results through dashboards. Implement targeted coaching workflows based on AI-identified improvement areas. Measure quality score trends and customer satisfaction improvement over 6 months.
