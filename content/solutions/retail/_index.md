Retail AI deployments concentrate on three core business problems: predicting demand accurately enough to reduce overstock and stockouts, surfacing the right product to the right customer at the right moment, and automating the operational workflows that otherwise require manual review at scale.

## Solution Areas

**[Demand Forecasting](demand-forecasting/)** — Predict purchase volumes at the SKU-store level using historical sales, calendar effects, weather, and promotion data. Accurate demand forecasts reduce carrying costs from overstock and lost revenue from stockouts. Models range from classical time-series methods (ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to gradient-boosted trees with lag features and deep learning approaches for large assortments with correlated demand patterns.

**[Inventory Management](inventory-management/)** — Optimize reorder points, safety stock levels, and replenishment timing based on demand forecasts and supplier lead times. AI inventory systems adapt to distribution changes in real time rather than relying on static reorder rules calibrated for average conditions.

**[Recommendation Engine](recommendation-engine/)** — Personalize product recommendations at the user or session level using collaborative filtering, content-based similarity, or hybrid approaches. Recommendations surface in product discovery, cart upsell, post-purchase, and email re-engagement contexts. Latency and freshness constraints drive architecture choices: real-time retrieval from pre-computed embedding indices versus online computation.

**[Price Optimization](price-optimization/)** — Dynamically set prices based on demand elasticity, competitor pricing, inventory levels, and margin targets. AI pricing models balance revenue maximization against conversion rate and brand positioning constraints.

**[Visual Search](visual-search/)** — Enable customers to find products by uploading an image. Computer vision models extract product embeddings from query images, which are matched against the product catalog's embedding index using approximate nearest neighbor search.

**[Customer Segmentation](customer-segmentation/)** — Cluster customers by purchasing behavior, lifetime value trajectory, and engagement patterns. Segments inform marketing campaign targeting, loyalty tier design, and personalization strategies.

**[Marketplace Disputes](marketplace-disputes/)** — Classify and route seller disputes, returns, and escalations using NLP and rule-based triage. Automate resolution for high-confidence cases; route ambiguous cases to human agents with full context.
