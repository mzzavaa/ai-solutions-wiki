Inventory is the largest asset on most retailers' balance sheets and the largest source of working capital consumption. Carrying too much inventory ties up capital and leads to markdowns; carrying too little causes stockouts and lost sales. AI inventory management optimizes the balance across thousands of SKU-location combinations, achieving service level targets at minimum inventory investment.

## The Problem

A retailer with 500 stores and 50,000 SKUs manages 25 million SKU-location combinations. Each combination requires decisions about target stock levels, reorder points, order quantities, and allocation priorities. Traditional approaches use simple rules: reorder when stock drops below X units, order enough for Y weeks of supply. These rules are static and cannot adapt to changing demand patterns, lead time variability, or cross-location substitution effects.

The result is a chronic imbalance: popular items are under-stocked in high-demand locations while slow-moving items accumulate in low-demand locations. Industry estimates suggest 5-10% of retail revenue is lost to stockouts while 3-5% of inventory value is written off annually due to obsolescence.

## AI Approach

**Probabilistic demand forecasting** - Amazon Forecast generates demand distributions (not just point forecasts) for each SKU-location. The probability distribution captures demand uncertainty, which is the key input for safety stock calculations. Higher demand uncertainty requires higher safety stock to achieve the same service level.

**Dynamic safety stock optimization** - SageMaker models calculate optimal safety stock levels that achieve target service levels at minimum inventory cost. Unlike fixed safety stock rules, the model adjusts for demand variability, lead time variability, and review period frequency. Safety stock is recalculated weekly as demand patterns evolve.

**Allocation optimization** - When available supply is less than total demand across locations, the allocation model distributes inventory to maximize total sales (or margin) across the network. This requires estimating the marginal value of each additional unit at each location - the last unit allocated to a high-demand store has more value than the first excess unit at a low-demand store.

**Multi-echelon planning** - For retailers with distribution center and store networks, inventory positioning across echelons is optimized jointly. Holding inventory at the DC provides flexibility to respond to demand variability across stores; pushing inventory to stores reduces replenishment lead time. The optimal split depends on demand predictability, transportation costs, and store capacity constraints.

## Architecture

Sales data, inventory positions, and supply chain parameters flow from the retail ERP into Redshift. Amazon Forecast generates probabilistic demand forecasts. SageMaker models calculate replenishment recommendations (what to order, where, and when). Recommendations are pushed to the ERP's purchasing and allocation modules via API. CloudWatch monitors key metrics: service level achievement, inventory turns, and days of supply.

## Key Considerations

**Service level differentiation** - Not all products deserve the same service level. High-margin, high-velocity items warrant higher service levels than low-margin long-tail products. The optimization should accept differentiated service level targets by product segment.

**Substitution effects** - When a product is out of stock, customers may substitute a similar product rather than leave empty-handed. Substitution modeling reduces the true cost of stockouts and can lower optimal inventory levels for products with close substitutes.

**Lead time uncertainty** - Supplier lead time variability is often a larger driver of required safety stock than demand variability. The model should incorporate actual lead time distributions from purchase order history, not just average lead times.

**Cross-referencing** - Inventory management depends directly on demand forecasting accuracy and connects to supply chain optimization in logistics. Improvements in forecast accuracy translate directly to inventory reductions at equivalent service levels.

## Next Steps

Analyze current service level performance and inventory productivity by category to identify the largest improvement opportunities. Pilot AI-driven replenishment for a product category with high stockout rates or excessive overstock. Measure the impact on service levels, inventory turns, and markdown rates over a full seasonal cycle.
