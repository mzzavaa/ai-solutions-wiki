Product recommendations drive 10-30% of e-commerce revenue for retailers with mature personalization systems. The gap between a generic "bestsellers" list and a well-tuned recommendation engine is substantial: personalized recommendations increase click-through rates by 2-5x and average order value by 10-20%. AI recommendation engines learn individual preferences from behavior and serve relevant suggestions in real time.

## The Problem

A typical online retailer offers tens of thousands to millions of products. Customers cannot browse the full catalog, and search requires knowing what to look for. Without recommendations, product discovery depends entirely on navigation, search, and merchandising - all of which are generic or require manual curation. The challenge is surfacing the right products for each customer at each moment in their shopping journey.

## AI Approach

**Collaborative filtering** - Amazon Personalize implements user-based and item-based collaborative filtering. Users who behave similarly (view, purchase, rate the same products) receive recommendations based on each other's preferences. This approach excels at discovering non-obvious product relationships that content-based systems miss.

**Content-based filtering** - Product attributes (category, brand, price, description, images) are used to recommend items similar to those the customer has shown interest in. SageMaker embedding models create product vectors from both structured attributes and unstructured descriptions, enabling similarity-based recommendations even for products with no interaction history.

**Session-based recommendations** - For anonymous visitors or the early portion of a session, real-time behavioral signals (current page views, search queries, cart contents) drive recommendations. Recurrent neural network models on SageMaker process the session sequence to predict next likely interactions.

**Contextual re-ranking** - Candidate recommendations are re-ranked based on real-time context: time of day, device type, geographic location, current promotions, and inventory availability. A product that is out of stock or not available for delivery to the customer's location is suppressed regardless of relevance score.

## Architecture

Interaction events (views, clicks, add-to-cart, purchases) stream from the website and app to Kinesis Data Streams. Personalize consumes these events for real-time model updates. Batch model retraining runs nightly on the full interaction dataset stored in S3. Recommendation requests are served via API Gateway with sub-100ms latency, backed by Personalize real-time endpoints and a DynamoDB cache for high-traffic product pages.

## Key Considerations

**Cold start** - New users and new products lack interaction history. For new users, popularity-based and session-based recommendations bridge the gap until sufficient behavior is observed. For new products, content-based features enable immediate recommendation eligibility.

**Diversity and serendipity** - Recommendation engines optimized purely for predicted relevance tend toward redundancy - showing variations of what the customer already bought. Diversity constraints ensure exposure to different categories and discovery of new products.

**Business rules** - Recommendations must respect business constraints: margin targets, inventory clearing priorities, brand partnerships, and category exclusions. The recommendation engine should accept business rules as re-ranking constraints rather than hard-coding them into the model.

**Cross-referencing** - Recommendation engines share architecture patterns with content recommendation systems in media and customer segmentation approaches. Product recommendations also benefit from demand forecasting signals to avoid recommending soon-to-be-unavailable items.

## Next Steps

Implement Amazon Personalize with the existing interaction event stream. Start with a simple recommendation placement (product detail page, "customers also bought") and A/B test against the current approach. Measure impact on click-through rate, conversion rate, and average order value. Expand to additional placements (homepage, email, cart page) based on measured lift.
