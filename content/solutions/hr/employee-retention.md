Employee turnover is one of the most expensive workforce challenges. Replacing an employee costs 50-200% of their annual salary when accounting for recruitment, onboarding, training, productivity ramp-up, and lost institutional knowledge. AI attrition prediction identifies employees at risk of leaving before they resign, enabling proactive retention interventions that are far more effective than reactive counteroffers.

## The Problem

HR teams typically learn about attrition risk when an employee submits a resignation - at which point retention efforts have a low success rate and often involve expensive counteroffers that set problematic precedents. Earlier indicators exist in organizational data: changes in engagement, performance patterns, compensation competitiveness, career progression velocity, and manager relationships. But these signals are distributed across multiple systems and too numerous for HR to monitor manually across a large workforce.

## AI Approach

**Attrition risk modeling** - SageMaker models predict the probability of voluntary departure for each employee within a specified time horizon (typically 3-6 months). Features include: compensation relative to market and internal peers, time since last promotion, manager change history, engagement survey scores, performance trajectory, commute distance, and tenure. The model is trained on historical data linking these features to actual departures.

**Driver analysis** - Beyond predicting who is at risk, the model identifies why. SHAP value analysis reveals which factors contribute most to each individual's risk score. One employee may be at risk due to compensation; another due to career stagnation; another due to a manager change. Different risk drivers require different interventions.

**Cohort analytics** - Redshift aggregates attrition patterns across organizational dimensions: department, manager, location, job family, tenure band, and demographic groups. QuickSight dashboards identify systemic retention problems - a specific department or manager with attrition 3x the organizational average warrants structural investigation, not individual interventions.

**Intervention effectiveness** - The model tracks the outcomes of retention interventions (promotion, compensation adjustment, role change, development opportunity) to identify which actions are most effective for different risk profiles. This evidence base informs future retention decisions.

## Architecture

HR data from the HRIS, compensation system, performance management system, and engagement survey platform flows into Redshift. SageMaker models score the entire workforce monthly. Risk scores and driver analysis are presented to HR business partners through QuickSight dashboards with appropriate access controls. Intervention tracking captures actions taken and subsequent outcomes for model improvement.

## Key Considerations

**Privacy and ethics** - Employee monitoring must comply with labor laws, works council agreements (in European jurisdictions), and GDPR. Employees should be informed that workforce analytics are conducted. Individual risk scores should be visible only to HR professionals, not to managers or peers.

**Self-fulfilling prophecy** - If managers learn that an employee is flagged as "at risk," their behavior toward that employee may change in ways that accelerate departure. Risk information should be shared carefully and paired with constructive action plans.

**Voluntary vs. regrettable attrition** - Not all departures are losses. The model should focus on predicting departure of high-performing employees (regrettable attrition), not all attrition. Retention resources should be directed at employees the organization wants to keep.

**Cross-referencing** - Employee retention analytics share predictive patterns with student analytics in education (early warning systems) and customer segmentation in retail (churn prediction).

## Next Steps

Consolidate HR data sources into an analytical warehouse. Build a retrospective model on 3-5 years of turnover data. Validate against held-out historical data. If the model achieves meaningful discrimination (AUC > 0.70), pilot with a group of HR business partners, providing risk reports alongside actionable intervention recommendations. Track whether AI-informed retention interventions reduce attrition compared to the baseline.
