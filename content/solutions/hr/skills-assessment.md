Organizations need to understand the skills their workforce has and the skills they will need. Traditional skills assessment relies on self-reported surveys and manager evaluations, which are subjective, infrequent, and often inaccurate. AI skills assessment infers skills from observable data, maps organizational skill inventories, identifies gaps, and recommends targeted development programs.

## The Problem

Most organizations cannot accurately answer the question "What skills do we have?" Self-reported skills are unreliable: employees overestimate strengths in popular areas and underreport niche capabilities. Manager assessments are inconsistent and biased by recency and visibility. The result is talent decisions made with incomplete information: hiring for skills that exist internally, underinvesting in critical skill gaps, and misallocating training budgets.

The pace of skill evolution compounds the problem. Technology skills have an estimated half-life of 2-5 years. The skills needed for a role today may differ substantially from those needed in two years. Static skills inventories become outdated between updates.

## AI Approach

**Skill inference from work artifacts** - Bedrock analyzes observable work outputs (code repositories, documents, presentations, project deliverables) to infer demonstrated skills. An employee who writes Python code daily demonstrates Python proficiency regardless of whether they listed it on a survey. This approach captures skills that are actively used, not just claimed.

**Skills taxonomy construction** - SageMaker clustering and NLP models build and maintain a skills taxonomy from job descriptions, training catalogs, industry frameworks, and skills mentioned across the organization. Amazon Neptune stores the skills graph, including relationships between skills (prerequisites, complements, alternatives). The taxonomy evolves automatically as new skills emerge.

**Gap analysis** - The system compares current workforce skills against target skill profiles for current roles and future strategic needs. Gaps are quantified at individual, team, and organizational levels. The analysis identifies: skills in surplus (reducing urgency to hire), critical gaps (skills needed but scarce), and emerging gaps (skills that will be needed based on strategic direction).

**Development recommendation** - Based on individual skill gaps and learning preferences, the system recommends targeted development: specific courses, projects, mentors, and stretch assignments. Recommendations are personalized using the same techniques as learning path optimization in education.

## Architecture

Data from HR systems, learning platforms, work collaboration tools, and code repositories flows into the analytics platform. Bedrock processes work artifacts for skill inference. SageMaker models maintain the skills taxonomy and perform gap analysis. Neptune stores the skills graph. QuickSight dashboards present skills inventories and gap analysis to HR leaders and managers.

## Key Considerations

**Privacy and consent** - Analyzing work artifacts to infer skills must comply with employee privacy rights and data protection regulations. Employees should consent to skills inference and understand what data is analyzed. Skills data should not be used for performance evaluation without separate consent.

**Validation** - Inferred skills should be validated by the employee (confirming or correcting AI assessments) and periodically verified through practical assessment where appropriate. Self-correction mechanisms build data quality over time.

**Bias mitigation** - Skills inference from work artifacts may underrepresent contributions that are less visible (mentoring, organizational work, work done in collaboration). Ensure the inference model captures diverse forms of contribution.

**Cross-referencing** - Skills assessment connects to workforce planning, recruitment automation (matching candidate skills to gaps), learning path optimization in education, and compensation analytics (skill-based pay).

## Next Steps

Define the initial skills taxonomy aligned with organizational strategy. Pilot skill inference for a specific skill domain (e.g., technology skills from code repositories) where observable artifacts are readily available. Validate inferred skills against self-reported and manager-assessed skills. Expand to additional skill domains once the inference methodology is validated.
