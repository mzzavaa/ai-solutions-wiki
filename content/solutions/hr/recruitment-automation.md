Recruitment is one of the most time-intensive HR functions and one of the most directly amenable to AI assistance. High-volume screening (processing hundreds of applications per role), job description writing, candidate outreach, and interview logistics are all tasks where AI reduces manual work while improving consistency.

## Where AI Helps Most

**High-volume resume screening** - For roles receiving 200+ applications, manual review of every resume is impractical. AI screening provides a first-pass triage: ranking candidates by fit based on required skills, experience, and qualifications, so recruiters review a shortlist rather than the full applicant pool.

**Job description optimization** - LLMs analyze job descriptions for language patterns associated with lower response rates (unnecessarily exclusive requirements, jargon, gendered language) and suggest improvements. This is a high-leverage change: a better job description improves the quality of the applicant pool before screening begins.

**Candidate outreach personalization** - AI drafts personalized outreach messages for sourcing and follow-up, reducing recruiter time on repetitive communication tasks while maintaining a personal tone.

**Interview scheduling** - Conversational AI handles scheduling coordination between candidates and interviewers, eliminating the back-and-forth email exchanges that consume recruiter time.

**Offer letter generation** - Standard offer letters are generated automatically from structured data (role, level, compensation), reducing HR administration overhead.

## Architecture for Resume Screening

A resume screening pipeline:
1. Applications are received (ATS or direct upload) and stored in S3
2. Amazon Textract extracts text from PDF and Word resumes
3. A Bedrock LLM call processes each resume against the job description: extracting relevant experience, skills, and qualifications as structured JSON
4. A scoring function ranks candidates against required and preferred criteria
5. Top-ranked candidates are surfaced in a recruiter review queue with the AI-extracted summary alongside the original resume

The recruiter reviews the shortlist, confirms or adjusts rankings, and moves qualified candidates to the next stage. The AI handles the volume; the recruiter handles the judgment.

## Bias Mitigation - Non-Negotiable

AI resume screening has well-documented risks of encoding and amplifying historical hiring biases. Mitigation is not optional in production systems:

**Use skills-based criteria** - Screen on demonstrated skills and relevant experience, not proxies like university prestige or company names, which correlate with demographic factors.

**Audit regularly for disparate impact** - Measure pass-through rates by demographic group (where legally permissible to collect). Statistically significant disparities require investigation and remediation.

**Human review at every stage** - AI scoring informs, not replaces, recruiter judgment. No candidate should be rejected by AI alone without human review.

**Transparency with candidates** - In jurisdictions with AI hiring laws (New York City, Illinois, and others), disclosure of AI use in hiring decisions may be required. Consult your legal and compliance team before deploying.

**Avoid resume gaps and non-standard career patterns as negative signals** - These correlate with caregiving responsibilities and other protected characteristics.

## Compliance Context

AI hiring tools are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny. Laws in multiple jurisdictions require bias audits, disclosure, and in some cases candidate notice and opt-out rights. The regulatory landscape is evolving rapidly. Any AI-assisted hiring system should be reviewed by employment counsel before deployment and audited annually for bias and compliance.

## Realistic Scope

AI works best at the highest-volume, most criteria-driven screening stages. For senior and specialized roles where cultural fit, leadership potential, and nuanced skills are the primary criteria, AI screening adds less value and human judgment matters more. Match the level of AI involvement to where systematic criteria-based assessment genuinely helps.
