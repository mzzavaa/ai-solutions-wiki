Automatic transcription is one of the most mature AI capabilities available today - raw word accuracy for clear audio in major languages exceeds 95% with current models. But "transcription" for production use almost always means something harder: knowing not just what was said, but who said it, in a format that is usable downstream. That harder problem is where most implementations run into difficulty.

## The Speaker Attribution Challenge

Speaker diarization - assigning each spoken segment to a specific speaker - sounds straightforward and presents several non-trivial problems in practice:

**Speaker count** - Systems need to know (or infer) how many speakers are present. A meeting with consistent participation is easier than one where participants join and leave.

**Overlapping speech** - When two speakers talk simultaneously, segment boundaries become ambiguous. Diarization systems handle this differently, and error rates increase significantly in high-overlap audio.

**Speaker consistency** - The same physical speaker should receive the same label throughout a recording. Errors in long recordings (90+ minutes) compound, and "speaker drift" - where the same speaker is split into two or more labels - degrades usability.

**Name resolution** - Diarization assigns Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc. For production transcripts, you need actual names, which requires either enrollment data or a post-processing step.

## Architecture

**Audio preparation** - Audio quality is the single largest driver of accuracy. If the source permits it, split multi-speaker recordings into per-channel tracks (one track per speaker) before transcription. AWS Transcribe's channel identification mode handles this case better than single-track diarization.

**AWS Transcribe with diarization** - For single-track recordings, use `ShowSpeakerLabel: true` in the Transcribe API call. Set `MaxSpeakerLabels` to match your expected speaker count. For audio under 2 hours, the standard asynchronous transcription job is appropriate. For longer recordings, split audio before processing.

**Post-processing with Bedrock** - The raw Transcribe output contains speaker labels but no names, and may have diarization errors that are apparent in context. A Bedrock call with Claude can:
- Resolve speaker names from context clues ("Thank you, Maria") when present
- Smooth obvious diarization errors (a single word attributed to the wrong speaker)
- Format the transcript into readable paragraphs rather than per-sentence segments
- Generate a structured summary with speaker attribution

**Quality scoring** - For production pipelines, add a confidence signal. Transcribe returns word-level confidence scores. Flag transcripts with high proportions of low-confidence words for human review rather than passing poor-quality output downstream.

## Practical Accuracy Expectations

With good-quality audio (recorded meeting with headset microphones, or broadcast audio): 92-96% word accuracy, 85-90% speaker attribution accuracy.

With poor-quality audio (phone recordings, background noise, accented speech not well represented in training data): accuracy drops substantially. The post-processing Bedrock step can partially compensate by using context to correct obvious errors, but cannot recover a fundamentally poor transcription.

For accessibility and legal compliance use cases, human review of AI-generated transcripts is standard practice. The AI transcript provides a high-quality starting point that reduces review time by 60-75% compared to transcribing from scratch.

## Integration Points

Transcripts integrate naturally with downstream AI workflows: feeding a transcript into a Bedrock summarization or classification pipeline is more reliable than working from audio directly. Many document intelligence use cases work better when the input is text, making transcription a useful upstream component even when transcription itself is not the primary goal.
