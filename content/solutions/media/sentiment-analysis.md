Understanding audience sentiment is critical for media organizations, brands, and public relations teams. Traditional approaches - surveys, focus groups, manual media monitoring - are slow, expensive, and sample-limited. AI sentiment analysis processes millions of text sources in real time, providing continuous visibility into how audiences, customers, and the public respond to content, products, brands, and events.

## The Problem

The volume of public opinion expressed through social media, news comments, reviews, forums, and messaging platforms far exceeds what human analysts can monitor. A single product launch or news event can generate thousands of reactions within minutes. By the time manual monitoring detects a sentiment shift, the narrative may have already solidified.

Simple positive/negative classification is insufficient for actionable intelligence. Organizations need to understand what specifically drives sentiment (which product feature, which editorial decision, which executive statement), how sentiment varies across audience segments, and how it evolves over time.

## AI Approach

**Real-time sentiment classification** - Amazon Comprehend processes text streams to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, mixed) at the document and entity level. For more nuanced analysis, Bedrock performs aspect-based sentiment analysis: extracting specific topics mentioned and the sentiment associated with each. "Love the camera but the battery life is terrible" contains positive sentiment about the camera and negative sentiment about battery life.

**Entity and topic extraction** - Comprehend identifies entities (people, organizations, products, locations) and key phrases in each text. This enables filtering and aggregation by topic: what is the sentiment about a specific product, person, or event across all sources?

**Trend detection** - Kinesis processes the text stream in real time. SageMaker time-series models detect sentiment shifts: sudden changes (viral events, PR crises) and gradual trends (deteriorating brand perception over weeks). Alert thresholds trigger notifications when sentiment deviates significantly from baseline.

**Audience segmentation** - Sentiment is analyzed by audience segment: geographic region, platform (Twitter vs. Reddit vs. news comments), and inferred demographics. Different segments may have dramatically different reactions to the same event, and segment-specific insights drive targeted response strategies.

## Architecture

Text data is collected from social media APIs, news feeds, review platforms, and internal feedback channels into Kinesis. Comprehend and Bedrock process the stream for sentiment and entity extraction. Results are stored in OpenSearch for real-time querying and in Redshift for historical analysis. QuickSight dashboards provide real-time sentiment monitoring, trend visualization, and drill-down by topic, entity, source, and segment.

## Key Considerations

**Language and cultural context** - Sentiment analysis accuracy varies by language, and sarcasm, irony, and cultural idioms challenge all current models. Multilingual models are essential for European markets. Human validation of edge cases informs model improvement.

**Signal vs. noise** - Social media contains enormous volumes of irrelevant, bot-generated, and spam content. Filtering and source quality assessment are prerequisites for meaningful sentiment analysis.

**Actionability** - Sentiment data is valuable only if it triggers action. Define response protocols for sentiment alerts: who is notified, what is the escalation path, and what response options are available.

**Cross-referencing** - Sentiment analysis connects to content moderation (identifying harmful content), ad targeting (brand safety), customer support (sentiment detection in support interactions), and quality monitoring.

## Next Steps

Define the monitoring scope: which brands, products, topics, and platforms to track. Set up data collection from the primary platforms. Deploy Comprehend for baseline sentiment classification and validate against manually coded samples. Build the real-time dashboard and alert system. Refine with aspect-based analysis using Bedrock once the baseline system is operational.
