Live captioning makes audio and video content accessible to deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences, viewers in noisy environments, and non-native speakers. Regulatory requirements in many European jurisdictions mandate captioning for broadcast content. Traditional live captioning relies on trained stenographers or re-speakers, which is expensive (100-300 EUR per hour) and limited by human availability. AI live captioning provides immediate, scalable captioning at a fraction of the cost.

## The Problem

Demand for live captioning exceeds the supply of trained captioners. Broadcast regulations require increasing percentages of content to be captioned, including live content. Corporate events, webinars, and meetings also benefit from captioning but rarely justify the cost of human captioners. The result is a significant accessibility gap: much live content remains uncaptioned.

Multilingual audiences create an additional challenge. A European organization broadcasting an event to audiences across the continent would need separate captioners for each language - impractical and expensive.

## AI Approach

**Real-time speech recognition** - Amazon Transcribe Streaming processes live audio feeds and generates text in real time with latency under 2 seconds. Custom vocabulary lists improve accuracy for domain-specific terminology (medical terms, product names, technical jargon). Speaker identification distinguishes between multiple speakers in panel discussions or interviews.

**Error correction and formatting** - Raw speech-to-text output requires formatting: punctuation, capitalization, paragraph breaks, and speaker labels. Bedrock post-processes the raw transcript to apply formatting rules, correct obvious recognition errors using context, and format output for display (caption line length, reading speed constraints).

**Real-time translation** - Amazon Translate converts captions into target languages in real time. For critical broadcasts, Bedrock provides higher-quality translations that capture nuance, idiom, and cultural context. The system supports simultaneous output in multiple languages from a single source audio feed.

**Custom domain adaptation** - For specialized content (legal proceedings, medical conferences, technical broadcasts), custom language models on SageMaker improve recognition accuracy for domain vocabulary. These models are trained on domain-specific transcripts and updated as terminology evolves.

## Architecture

Live audio is captured from broadcast feeds, microphone inputs, or streaming platforms. Transcribe Streaming processes the audio in real time. Lambda functions manage the post-processing pipeline: formatting, error correction, and translation. Captions are delivered to display systems (broadcast overlay, web player, mobile app) via WebSocket connections through API Gateway. The architecture supports multiple simultaneous output languages with independent latency management.

## Key Considerations

**Accuracy standards** - Broadcast captioning accuracy standards typically require 98%+ accuracy. AI captioning currently achieves 90-95% accuracy for clear speech in supported languages, with lower accuracy for accented speech, overlapping speakers, and noisy environments. Hybrid approaches (AI captioning with human editor) achieve broadcast standards at lower cost than fully human captioning.

**Latency management** - Caption display should be within 2-4 seconds of speech for live broadcasts. Processing pipeline latency must be monitored and optimized, particularly when translation adds a processing step.

**Language coverage** - Transcribe supports major European languages, but accuracy varies. Languages with fewer training resources may require custom model development. Minority languages may not be supported.

**Cross-referencing** - Live captioning connects to accessibility automation solutions in the wiki, content moderation (captioned content enables text-based content analysis), and shares speech recognition patterns with sentiment detection in customer support.

## Next Steps

Pilot AI captioning on internal events where accuracy requirements are lower than broadcast standards. Measure word error rate and user satisfaction. For broadcast applications, implement a hybrid workflow where AI generates draft captions that a human editor corrects in real time. Compare cost and accuracy against fully human captioning to build the business case.
