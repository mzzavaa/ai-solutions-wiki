Media AI applications accelerate production workflows, extend content reach through accessibility, and improve audience matching for monetization. The volume economics are distinctive: a broadcaster producing thousands of hours of content annually cannot manually caption, tag, and moderate at scale. AI handles the high-volume repetitive layer while human editors handle creative judgment. Content moderation is the most consequential application — platforms are legally and reputationally obligated to remove harmful content at scale, and the speed-accuracy tradeoff has direct regulatory implications (EU Digital Services Act, US FOSTA-SESTA).

## Solution Areas

**[AI Transcription](ai-transcription/)** — Convert speech to text across live and recorded content using automatic speech recognition (ASR) models. Modern transformer-based ASR (OpenAI Whisper, AWS Transcribe) achieves word error rates below 5% on broadcast-quality audio. Outputs feed downstream applications: subtitles, search indexing, compliance archives, and content analysis.

**[Live Captioning](live-captioning/)** — Generate real-time captions for live broadcasts, events, and streaming with sub-2-second latency. Required for FCC broadcast compliance and WCAG 2.1 AA digital accessibility. Hybrid architectures combine on-device ASR for speed with cloud models for accuracy, with human stenographer fallback for high-stakes coverage.

**[Content Moderation](content-moderation/)** — Detect policy-violating content (violence, hate speech, CSAM, misinformation) across video, image, and text at platform scale. Computer vision models flag candidate content; human reviewers make final decisions on ambiguous cases. Moderator wellbeing and queue management are active operational challenges — the psychological burden of reviewing harmful content is documented in platform transparency reports.

**[Content Recommendation](content-recommendation/)** — Match audiences to content using collaborative filtering, content-based features, and contextual signals (time of day, device, session behavior). Recommendation systems drive a disproportionate share of engagement on streaming platforms — Netflix attributes over 80% of watched content to recommendations. Diversity and serendipity objectives counter filter bubble effects.

**[AI Video Editing](ai-video-editing/)** — Automate edit assembly, highlight extraction, and b-roll selection from raw footage. Scene detection, speaker diarization, and quality scoring reduce the editorial time from raw capture to publishable cut. Particularly valuable for live sports, news, and high-volume social content.

**[Ad Targeting](ad-targeting/)** — Match advertising inventory to audience segments using viewing behavior, contextual signals, and first-party identity data. Contextual targeting (matching ads to content context rather than user identity) is growing as third-party cookie deprecation constrains behavioral targeting. ML models optimize CPM and fill rate across programmatic demand sources.

**[Content Metadata](content-metadata/)** — Auto-generate descriptive metadata (title, description, tags, mood, genre, scene descriptions) from content analysis. Accurate metadata improves search, recommendation, and licensing workflows. Multimodal models analyze audio, visual, and transcript signals together to produce richer annotations than single-modality classifiers.

**[Accessibility Automation](accessibility-automation/)** — Automate generation of audio descriptions, sign language overlay triggers, and enhanced subtitle formatting for audiences with disabilities. Audio description narrates visual content for blind and low-vision viewers — a legal requirement under ADA and EU Web Accessibility Directive for public sector content.

**[Audio Analysis](audio-analysis/)** — Classify audio content (music, speech, noise, silence), detect brand safety issues in UGC audio, identify music rights claims, and analyze speaker emotion and engagement. Complements video analysis in content moderation and metadata workflows.
