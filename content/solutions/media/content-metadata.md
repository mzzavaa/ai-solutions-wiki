Media libraries accumulate faster than they can be cataloged. A broadcaster with 40 years of archive and continuous live production generates more metadata work than any manual cataloging team can handle. Searchable, structured metadata is the foundation of content discovery, licensing, rights management, and SEO - and AI can generate it automatically at the point of ingest.

## What Metadata AI Can Generate

**Thematic tags** - Topic classification across a controlled vocabulary. A news segment about an EU energy policy vote should receive tags like `energy-policy`, `EU-Parliament`, `legislation` automatically. Bedrock with a well-designed taxonomy prompt handles this reliably for text-rich content.

**Scene and visual classification** - Amazon Rekognition detects objects, settings, activities, and faces in video. For a sports broadcaster, this means automated detection of sport type, venue type, action phases (goal, foul, celebration). For a documentary archive, scene settings (indoor/outdoor, urban/rural) and activity labels.

**Named entity extraction** - People, organizations, locations, and dates mentioned in audio or on-screen text. Combining Transcribe output with Comprehend entity extraction gives structured named entity tags without manual keywording.

**SEO metadata** - Title suggestions, meta descriptions, and keyword lists optimized for search. Bedrock generates these from transcript and visual classification data, calibrated to the platform (YouTube descriptions differ from broadcast EPG summaries differ from website article metadata).

**Content sensitivity flags** - Violence, adult content, and political sensitivity detection for content moderation and rights-clearing workflows. Rekognition's moderation labels cover many categories; Bedrock adds contextual judgment for edge cases.

## Pipeline Architecture

Ingest event (upload or live capture completion) triggers a Step Functions workflow:

1. Parallel track: audio extraction to Transcribe, video sampling (keyframes every N seconds) to Rekognition
2. Merge outputs: transcript text + visual labels + existing asset metadata
3. Bedrock classification and metadata generation call with merged context
4. Write structured metadata back to asset management system via API
5. Human review queue for low-confidence items or flagged content

Keyframe sampling rate affects both cost and accuracy. For fast-moving content, 1 frame per second is appropriate. For talking-head interview content, 1 frame per 10 seconds is sufficient. Variable sampling based on scene change detection (Rekognition can detect scene changes) optimizes the trade-off.

## Integration with Asset Management Systems

Metadata outputs need to land in your existing MAM (Media Asset Management) system. Most enterprise MAMs expose APIs for metadata writes. For systems without APIs, metadata export to CSV or XML for bulk import is the fallback. The AI pipeline produces structured JSON that maps cleanly to most schema formats.

## Accuracy and Quality Control

Thematic tagging accuracy depends heavily on how well the taxonomy prompt is designed. A media library that invests in writing clear, example-rich taxonomy definitions gets significantly better results than one using generic prompts. Budget time for taxonomy tuning - it is often the highest-leverage task in a metadata automation project.

Expected accuracy at launch: 80-88% agreement with human taggers on a controlled test set. With 6-8 weeks of feedback-loop tuning: 88-93%. The remaining gap is typically ambiguous items where reasonable catalogers would also disagree.
