Platforms hosting user-generated content face an enormous moderation challenge. Social media, comment sections, forums, and review platforms receive millions of submissions daily. Content that violates policies - hate speech, harassment, explicit imagery, misinformation, spam, copyright infringement - must be identified and actioned quickly to maintain user safety and regulatory compliance. AI moderation handles the volume that human moderation cannot.

## The Problem

The volume of user-generated content far exceeds human moderation capacity. A platform receiving 100 million posts per day cannot hire enough moderators to review every submission. Yet regulatory requirements (EU Digital Services Act, national content regulations) mandate timely removal of illegal content. Platforms that fail to moderate effectively face regulatory penalties, advertiser boycotts, and user exodus.

Human moderation also carries well-documented wellbeing costs. Moderators exposed to harmful content experience high rates of psychological distress. Reducing human exposure to harmful content while maintaining moderation quality is both an ethical and operational imperative.

## AI Approach

**Image and video moderation** - Amazon Rekognition detects explicit content, violence, and other visual policy violations in images and video. Custom moderation models on SageMaker extend detection to platform-specific policy categories. For video, key frame extraction and analysis enables real-time moderation of live and uploaded video content.

**Text moderation** - Amazon Comprehend detects sentiment and entities, while Bedrock performs nuanced policy evaluation of text content. Unlike keyword-based filters that are easily circumvented, LLM-based moderation understands context: distinguishing a discussion about hate speech (allowed) from actual hate speech (prohibited), or identifying policy violations expressed through euphemism, coded language, or implication.

**Policy-aware classification** - Bedrock evaluates content against the platform's specific content policies, not just generic categories. Each policy rule is encoded as part of the evaluation prompt, enabling rapid policy updates without model retraining. When a policy changes, the prompt is updated and enforcement begins immediately.

**Escalation and appeals** - Content flagged by AI is classified by severity: clearly violating content is automatically removed, borderline content is queued for human review, and content that receives user appeals is routed to specialized review teams. This tiered approach concentrates human judgment on the decisions that require it.

## Architecture

Content submissions flow through the moderation pipeline before publication (pre-moderation) or immediately after (reactive moderation). Rekognition processes images and video frames. Comprehend and Bedrock process text. Lambda functions aggregate moderation signals and apply platform-specific policy logic. Decisions (approve, remove, queue for review) are executed via the content management system. Moderation decisions and appeals are stored in DynamoDB for audit and model improvement. SageMaker models are retrained monthly on human moderator decisions.

## Key Considerations

**False positives and over-removal** - Aggressive moderation removes legitimate content (political speech, artistic expression, news reporting). The system must balance safety against freedom of expression. Transparent appeals processes and regular accuracy audits maintain trust.

**Adversarial evasion** - Users deliberately circumvent moderation through character substitution, image manipulation, and coded language. Models must be regularly updated to detect evolving evasion techniques.

**Regulatory compliance** - The EU Digital Services Act requires specific transparency, reporting, and appeals mechanisms for content moderation. The moderation system must support these requirements with appropriate audit trails and user notification workflows.

**Cross-referencing** - Content moderation connects to sentiment analysis (detecting harmful sentiment), ad targeting (brand safety), and shares NLP techniques with compliance monitoring in legal and document review processes.

## Next Steps

Audit current moderation performance: volume, accuracy, latency, and human moderator workload. Identify the content categories with the highest volume and clearest policy definitions. Deploy AI moderation for those categories first, with human review of a random sample to validate accuracy. Gradually expand AI coverage as accuracy is established, reducing human exposure to harmful content while maintaining moderation quality.
