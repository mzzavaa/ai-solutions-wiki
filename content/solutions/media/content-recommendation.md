Content discovery is the central challenge for media platforms. A streaming service with 50,000 titles, a news publisher with 500 articles per day, or a music platform with 100 million tracks cannot rely on users browsing to find what they want. Recommendation systems surface relevant content to each user, driving engagement, retention, and content monetization. The quality of recommendations directly impacts key business metrics: session duration, content consumption, subscriber retention, and advertising revenue.

## The Problem

Without recommendations, users default to browsing popular content or searching for known titles. This concentrates consumption on a small fraction of the catalog while the long tail of content remains undiscovered. For publishers, this means lower return on content investment. For users, it means missing content they would enjoy.

Content recommendation must balance multiple objectives: relevance (the user will enjoy this content), diversity (expose users to different content types), recency (surface new content), and business goals (promote original content, balance content costs, support advertising objectives).

## AI Approach

**Collaborative filtering** - Amazon Personalize learns user preferences from behavioral signals: views, completion rates, ratings, saves, and shares. Users with similar consumption patterns receive recommendations based on each other's preferences. This discovers non-obvious content relationships that metadata-based systems miss.

**Content-based signals** - SageMaker embedding models create content vectors from metadata (genre, cast, topic, style), transcripts, and visual features. Content similarity enables recommendations for new content with no consumption history and provides diversity within recommendation sets.

**Contextual adaptation** - Recommendations adapt to context: time of day (lighter content in the evening), device (shorter content on mobile), day of week (different patterns on weekdays versus weekends), and current mood signals (content consumed in the current session). DynamoDB stores user context for real-time personalization.

**Editorial integration** - AI recommendations operate alongside editorial curation. Editors can boost, pin, or suppress specific content within the recommendation framework. This enables editorial voice and journalistic judgment to influence what users see while maintaining personalization.

## Architecture

User interaction events stream from client applications through Kinesis to Personalize for real-time model updates. Batch model retraining runs daily on the full interaction dataset in S3. Recommendation requests are served via API Gateway with sub-100ms latency. Content metadata and editorial rules are maintained in DynamoDB. A/B testing infrastructure enables continuous experimentation with recommendation strategies.

## Key Considerations

**Filter bubbles** - Pure relevance optimization can narrow users' content diet over time. Intentional diversity injection and serendipity mechanisms expose users to content outside their established preferences.

**Cold start** - New users and new content lack interaction history. For new users, popularity-based and contextual recommendations bridge the gap. For new content, metadata-based similarity and editorial boosting ensure initial exposure.

**Metrics alignment** - Optimize for metrics that align with long-term business health. Click-through rate optimization can favor clickbait; session duration optimization can favor addictive patterns. Consider user satisfaction and retention alongside engagement metrics.

**Cross-referencing** - Content recommendation shares architecture and approaches with recommendation engines in retail, ad targeting in media, and learning path optimization in education.

## Next Steps

Implement Amazon Personalize with the existing interaction event stream. Start with a single recommendation placement (homepage, "next up" suggestions). A/B test personalized recommendations against the current approach (editorial curation, popularity ranking). Measure impact on engagement metrics and user satisfaction. Iterate on the model and expand placements based on measured improvement.
