Accessibility mandates for broadcasters are expanding across Europe and North America. In the EU, the European Accessibility Act and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive require broadcasters to meet progressively higher thresholds for subtitled, audio-described, and sign-language content. Compliance is no longer optional - and manual production of accessibility assets at scale is not economically viable. AI automation has become the practical path forward.

## Subtitle Generation at Scale

Automated subtitle generation with AWS Transcribe delivers production-quality output for live and recorded content. The key distinction between basic transcription and broadcast-ready subtitles is formatting: subtitle files require specific timing, line length limits (typically 42 characters per line), speaker identification, and compliance with national broadcasting standards such as EBU-TT or SRT formats.

A working pipeline for recorded content:
1. Ingest video to S3, trigger Lambda on upload
2. Extract audio track, submit to Transcribe with diarization enabled
3. Post-process with Bedrock to apply line-breaking rules, merge over-segmented segments, and flag low-confidence words for review
4. Convert to target subtitle format and attach to media asset

For live broadcast, AWS Transcribe Streaming provides low-latency subtitles. Latency is typically 3-6 seconds, acceptable for most live programming. Sports and breaking news benefit from domain-specific custom vocabularies - team names, player names, and location names require upfront vocabulary configuration to reach acceptable accuracy.

## Audio Descriptions

Audio descriptions - narrated descriptions of visual content for visually impaired viewers - are harder to automate than subtitles. The challenge is identifying what is visually significant (action, text on screen, expressions, scene changes) and generating natural language descriptions that fit within gaps in dialogue.

AI handles scene analysis using Amazon Rekognition for visual element detection, and Bedrock for generating natural-sounding description text. Human reviewers remain part of the workflow for dramatic content where description tone and timing matter. For archive digitization projects where backlog is the primary constraint, AI-first with human spot-check is the standard approach.

## WCAG Compliance Checking

Web-based media players and streaming platforms must meet WCAG 2.1 AA requirements. Automated compliance checking covers: color contrast in on-screen graphics, subtitle presentation (font size, background contrast, positioning), keyboard navigability, and screen reader compatibility of the player interface.

Bedrock can analyze page structure and flag accessibility issues in content management system templates, reducing the manual audit burden for large content libraries. This works well as a CI/CD check on template changes before deployment.

## Practical Expectations

Subtitle accuracy for studio-quality audio in major European languages: 93-97%. For phone-quality audio or heavy accents: 75-85%, requiring human QA. Audio description automation reduces manual effort by 40-60% - it generates drafts rather than finished assets. Human editors remain responsible for final quality in regulated contexts.

Organizations moving from zero automation to AI-assisted accessibility typically see compliance rates improve from 20-30% of catalog (what was manually affordable) to 80-90% within 6-12 months.
