Broadcast and media organizations generate enormous volumes of raw footage - sports events, news feeds, live broadcasts. The traditional editing workflow requires skilled editors to watch footage in real time or close to it, identify usable segments, and assemble cuts manually. For high-volume operations, this creates a production bottleneck that limits how much content can be processed and published.

## The Problem at Scale

A single live sports event might generate 90 minutes of multi-camera footage. A news broadcaster may receive 200+ video submissions per day from correspondents. The manual edit workflow does not scale: hiring more editors is expensive, and the quality of rushed edits under deadline pressure is inconsistent.

The specific pain points are well-defined:
- Identifying segments that are broadcast-quality versus unusable (poor audio, motion blur, off-topic)
- Detecting scene boundaries and action highlights without watching all footage
- Assembling rough cuts that editors can refine rather than build from scratch
- Generating metadata (topics, people present, locations) for archive and search

## The AI Solution Architecture

**Ingestion and transcoding** - Raw footage is uploaded to S3. An EventBridge rule triggers a Step Functions workflow. The first step transcodes the video to a standardized format using MediaConvert.

**Scene detection and analysis** - Amazon Rekognition Video processes the transcoded footage asynchronously. It returns shot detection data (where scene cuts occur), label detection (objects, activities, scenes), and face detection if relevant. For sports content, the shot boundary data alone reduces manual review time significantly.

**Highlight scoring** - A Lambda function processes Rekognition's output and applies domain-specific scoring logic. For sports, crowd audio intensity combined with rapid camera movement and close-up face detection correlates with highlight moments. For news, shot stability and speaker presence indicate usable segments. This scoring function is the part that benefits most from domain customization.

**Rough cut generation** - Scored segments above a confidence threshold are assembled into a rough cut using the MediaConvert API. The output is a timeline file (EDL or XML) compatible with the editing software the team already uses, plus an MP4 rough cut for quick review.

**Metadata and summary** - Bedrock (Claude) processes the transcript alongside the scene metadata to generate a structured summary: key topics covered, identified speakers (if combined with voice enrollment), suggested title and tags for the content management system.

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The output of this pipeline is designed to feed into existing editorial workflows, not replace them. Editors receive a rough cut that is typically 60-70% of the final edit rather than starting from raw footage. Quality control and final editorial decisions remain with human editors.

This positioning - AI as a production accelerator, not an editorial replacement - is important both technically and organizationally. It avoids the latency of perfect accuracy requirements and maintains editorial accountability.

## Results Pattern

Organizations implementing this architecture typically see a 50-70% reduction in the time from footage receipt to rough cut delivery. The productivity gain is largest for high-volume, lower-stakes content (sports highlights, event coverage) and smallest for complex investigative or documentary content where the editing decisions are themselves the editorial product.
