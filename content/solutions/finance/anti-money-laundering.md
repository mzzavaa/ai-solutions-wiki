Anti-money laundering (AML) compliance is one of the most expensive regulatory obligations for financial institutions. European banks collectively spend an estimated 20 billion EUR annually on AML compliance. Despite this investment, current systems generate false positive rates exceeding 95% - meaning investigators spend the vast majority of their time clearing alerts that are not suspicious. AI dramatically improves the signal-to-noise ratio while detecting complex laundering schemes that rule-based systems miss.

## The Problem

Traditional AML transaction monitoring uses rules: flag transactions above a threshold, flag round-number payments to high-risk jurisdictions, flag rapid movement of funds through multiple accounts. These rules are transparent to launderers who structure transactions to avoid them. They also generate enormous volumes of false positives because the rules are necessarily broad to avoid regulatory criticism for under-monitoring.

The investigation backlog is self-defeating: with 95%+ false positives, investigators develop alert fatigue and may process genuine suspicious activity less carefully. Regulatory penalties for AML failures continue to increase, with European banks receiving billions in fines over the past decade.

## AI Approach

**Risk-based transaction scoring** - SageMaker models score each transaction based on the probability that it is part of a laundering scheme. Features include transaction characteristics, customer risk profile, counterparty risk, behavioral patterns, and network context. The model is trained on confirmed suspicious activity reports (SARs) and investigation outcomes. Scored transactions replace or supplement rule-based alerts.

**Network analysis** - Amazon Neptune stores the network of relationships between customers, accounts, transactions, counterparties, and entities. Graph algorithms detect complex laundering patterns: layering (rapid movement through multiple accounts), structuring (splitting transactions to avoid thresholds), and shell company networks. These patterns are invisible to rule-based systems that evaluate individual transactions in isolation.

**Customer risk profiling** - Dynamic customer risk scores incorporate behavioral patterns, transaction profiles, and external risk factors (PEP status, adverse media, sanctions lists, geographic risk). Risk profiles update continuously as new information arrives, rather than relying on periodic reviews.

**Investigation automation** - Bedrock generates structured investigation packages for each alert: customer profile summary, transaction narrative, network visualization, risk indicators, and recommended investigation steps. This reduces the time per investigation from hours to minutes for straightforward cases, allowing investigators to focus on complex matters.

## Architecture

Transaction data flows from core banking systems into the AML pipeline. SageMaker scores transactions in near-real-time. Neptune maintains the entity network, updated with each transaction. High-scoring alerts are enriched with network analysis, customer risk context, and external data (sanctions, PEP lists, adverse media). Bedrock generates investigation packages. Completed investigations feed back into model training. The system interfaces with regulatory filing systems for SAR submission.

## Key Considerations

**Regulatory expectations** - Regulators expect institutions to use technology-driven approaches but also require transparency about how the system works. Model documentation, validation, and governance must meet regulatory standards for model risk management.

**Typology coverage** - The model must cover a comprehensive range of laundering typologies, not just the patterns most common in training data. Regular typology reviews against emerging threats (crypto laundering, trade-based laundering, professional enablers) ensure the system remains current.

**False positive reduction** - A primary metric is the false positive reduction rate compared to the existing system. Typical improvements range from 50-70% fewer false positives at equivalent or better detection rates. This must be demonstrated rigorously before decommissioning rule-based systems.

**Cross-referencing** - AML detection connects to fraud detection in finance, fraud detection in insurance, tax fraud detection in government, and compliance monitoring in legal. The network analysis techniques are shared across all financial crime domains.

## Next Steps

Quantify the current false positive rate and investigation backlog. Build a scoring model on historical investigation outcomes. Deploy in parallel with existing rule-based monitoring, comparing detection rates and false positive rates. Demonstrate to regulators that the AI approach maintains or improves detection before transitioning from rules to model-based monitoring.
