Financial fraud losses across Europe exceeded 4.3 billion EUR in 2023, with card fraud, authorized push payment (APP) fraud, and account takeover as the primary categories. Traditional rule-based fraud detection has fundamental limitations: rules are static (fraud patterns evolve faster), rules are transparent to fraudsters who probe them, and rules generate false positives that damage customer experience. AI-based fraud detection addresses all three limitations.

## Real-Time Transaction Scoring

Every payment transaction can be scored at the point of authorization - typically within 200ms to stay within payment network response time requirements. The scoring model evaluates:

- Transaction characteristics (amount, merchant category, geography, time)
- Account behavior baseline (is this amount, location, and merchant type normal for this customer?)
- Device and session signals (device fingerprint, IP reputation, typing pattern)
- Network graph features (relationships between accounts, merchants, devices)

Amazon SageMaker serves real-time scoring endpoints that integrate with payment authorization systems via REST API. The model output is a risk score that feeds a decisioning engine - approve, decline, or step-up authenticate.

Threshold calibration is a business decision: a lower score threshold catches more fraud but declines more legitimate transactions. The trade-off is quantifiable - cost per false positive (customer friction, potential churn) vs. cost per false negative (fraud loss). Most implementations tune thresholds separately by card type, customer segment, and transaction channel.

## Anomaly Detection and Behavioral Baselines

Transaction scoring works best when combined with behavioral baseline models. A single transaction may look normal in isolation but be obviously anomalous in the context of 12 months of account history. Techniques:

**Sequence modeling** - LSTM models trained on transaction sequences capture temporal patterns. A card used at 2am in a different country immediately after a domestic purchase is anomalous even if both individual transactions look normal.

**Peer group comparison** - A salary payment 3x above the account's historical salary range warrants review even if it matches the payer's profile.

**Velocity rules enhanced with context** - 10 transactions in one hour may be normal for a business account and highly suspicious for a personal account. AI contextualizes velocity signals.

## Authorized Push Payment Fraud

APP fraud - where the victim is socially engineered into authorizing a legitimate-looking payment - is the fastest-growing fraud category and the hardest to detect because the payment is technically authorized. AI detection looks at:

- First-payment-to-new-payee signals
- Payment amount relative to account history
- Beneficiary account age and transaction history
- Time pressure indicators in associated communications (where accessible)

Real-time friction injection (a warning message, a callback) at high-risk moments can prevent fraud without blocking transactions.

## Investigation Prioritization

High-volume fraud operations generate more suspicious activity than investigation teams can manually review. AI prioritization ranks alerts by estimated fraud probability, financial exposure, and evidence quality. Bedrock generates structured case summaries that give investigators the key facts in 30 seconds rather than requiring them to reconstruct the narrative from raw transaction data.

Expected fraud detection improvement over rule-based systems: 20-35% increase in fraud catch rate at equivalent false positive rate, or 40-60% reduction in false positive rate at equivalent detection rate.
