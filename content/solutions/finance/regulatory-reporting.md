Financial institutions submit hundreds of regulatory reports annually to supervisory authorities: capital adequacy, liquidity, transaction reporting, statistical returns, and anti-money-laundering filings. The reporting process is labor-intensive, error-prone, and high-stakes - reporting errors can trigger regulatory sanctions, restatements, and reputational damage. AI automates the most time-consuming aspects: data extraction, reconciliation, quality validation, and narrative generation.

## The Problem

Regulatory reporting requires aggregating data from dozens of source systems (core banking, trading systems, risk engines, general ledger), applying complex regulatory definitions and rules, and producing reports in prescribed formats. The rules change frequently - a typical large bank implements 50-100 regulatory change requests per year that affect reporting logic.

Manual reconciliation between source data and reported figures is the largest time sink. Discrepancies between systems require investigation and resolution, often under tight reporting deadlines. Data quality issues in source systems propagate into reports, requiring manual corrections that consume compliance team capacity.

## AI Approach

**Intelligent data mapping** - Bedrock analyzes regulatory reporting requirements (regulation text, reporting instructions, Q&A publications) and maps them to internal data fields. When requirements change, the system identifies which data mappings need updating and generates draft mapping specifications for human review. This reduces the regulatory change implementation cycle from weeks to days.

**Automated reconciliation** - SageMaker models identify and classify discrepancies between source systems and reporting outputs. Rather than checking every figure manually, the system focuses attention on material discrepancies and classifies them by likely root cause: timing differences, definitional differences, data quality issues, or genuine errors. Lambda functions orchestrate the reconciliation workflows across reporting cycles.

**Quality validation** - AI validates reports against multiple quality dimensions: internal consistency (do sub-totals match totals?), temporal consistency (are period-over-period changes explainable?), peer consistency (do reported figures align with industry benchmarks?), and regulatory validation rules. Anomalous figures are flagged with explanations of why they appear unusual.

**Narrative generation** - Many regulatory reports include qualitative sections: commentary on capital movements, explanations of significant changes, and risk narrative. Bedrock generates draft narratives from the quantitative data, highlighting material changes and their drivers. These drafts are reviewed and approved by subject matter experts.

## Architecture

Source system data flows into Redshift via ETL pipelines. Regulatory reporting logic is implemented as SQL transformations and Lambda functions. SageMaker models run quality checks on computed figures. Bedrock generates narrative sections and regulatory change analysis. Reports are output in required formats (XBRL, XML, CSV) and submitted via regulatory filing platforms. The full pipeline is orchestrated by Step Functions with audit logging at every stage.

## Key Considerations

**Audit trail** - Regulatory reporting requires end-to-end traceability from source data to reported figure. Every transformation, adjustment, and AI-assisted decision must be logged and auditable.

**Regulatory change management** - The system must adapt to frequent regulatory changes. A structured process for ingesting new requirements, updating data mappings, and validating against test cases is essential.

**Deadline management** - Reporting deadlines are non-negotiable. The pipeline must be designed for reliability, with fallback procedures for system failures and manual override capabilities.

**Cross-referencing** - Regulatory reporting connects to compliance monitoring in legal, anti-money-laundering in finance, and shares data quality patterns with document processing across industries.

## Next Steps

Identify the highest-effort reporting obligation (typically a complex prudential return or transaction report). Map the current manual process and quantify the time spent on data extraction, reconciliation, and quality checks. Automate the reconciliation and quality validation layers first - these provide immediate time savings without changing the core reporting logic.
