Compliance in financial services is operationally intensive. A mid-size bank might process thousands of customer due diligence reviews per month, generate hundreds of regulatory reports per year, and review millions of transactions for suspicious activity. The manual labor cost is substantial - and regulatory penalties for getting it wrong are severe. AI automation addresses the volume problem without reducing the quality of compliance judgment.

## KYC - Know Your Customer

Customer onboarding requires verifying identity, assessing risk, and screening against sanctions lists and politically exposed persons (PEP) databases. The manual process involves document review, database lookups, and risk assessment - often taking several days per customer.

AI accelerates KYC in several ways:

**Document extraction and verification** - Amazon Textract extracts data from identity documents (passports, national IDs, utility bills). Bedrock cross-references extracted data, flags inconsistencies, and generates a structured customer profile for review.

**Risk scoring** - Based on customer type, geography, industry, and relationship characteristics, AI models score customers by risk tier, prioritizing high-risk cases for human review and auto-approving low-risk customers within defined parameters.

**Ongoing monitoring** - KYC is not a one-time event. AI monitors for changes that trigger re-review: new adverse media mentions, changes in transaction patterns, sanctions list updates.

## AML Transaction Monitoring

Anti-money laundering transaction monitoring is one of the highest false-positive rate problems in financial compliance. Traditional rule-based systems flag 95-99% of alerts as false positives - the human review cost is enormous.

AI-based transaction monitoring uses behavioral baseline models: what is normal for this customer type, in this geography, at this relationship stage? Anomaly detection flags deviations rather than applying universal thresholds. The result is typically a 40-60% reduction in false positive rates with equivalent or better detection of actual suspicious activity.

The remaining alerts require human investigation. AI assists here too: Bedrock generates structured investigation summaries from transaction data, customer history, and peer comparison, reducing the time required per alert from 30-45 minutes to 10-15 minutes.

## Regulatory Reporting

Financial institutions file hundreds of reports to regulators annually: FINREP, COREP, MiFID transaction reports, EMIR derivatives reports. Generating these accurately from source data is data transformation work that AI handles well.

The practical implementation: Bedrock reads source data from data warehouses, applies regulatory calculation logic defined in structured prompts, generates report drafts, and flags items requiring manual validation. Human review focuses on exceptions rather than the full report population.

## Audit Trail Generation

Regulators require documentation of compliance decisions. AI systems that make or assist compliance decisions need to generate explainable audit trails: what data was reviewed, what was the risk assessment, who made the final decision, and on what basis.

Bedrock can generate human-readable rationale documents from structured compliance data. This reduces the documentation burden on compliance officers while improving consistency and completeness of records.
