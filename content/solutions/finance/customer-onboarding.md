Financial services customer onboarding must balance regulatory compliance (KYC, AML screening, suitability assessment) with customer experience. Traditional onboarding requires multiple document submissions, manual verification, and multi-day processing. AI automation reduces onboarding from days to minutes while improving compliance accuracy and reducing operational costs.

## The Problem

Banks and financial institutions are required to verify customer identity, screen against sanctions and PEP lists, assess risk profiles, and determine product suitability before opening accounts. Manual processes create friction that drives customer abandonment - digital bank account applications have abandonment rates of 40-60%. Each manual review costs 15-30 EUR in operational expense. For institutions processing millions of applications annually, the cost is substantial.

Regulatory requirements compound the complexity. The EU's Anti-Money Laundering Directives require risk-based customer due diligence, ongoing monitoring, and enhanced due diligence for high-risk customers. Non-compliance risks regulatory penalties and reputational damage.

## AI Approach

**Identity verification** - Amazon Rekognition performs facial comparison between a live selfie and the identity document photo. Liveness detection confirms the selfie is from a live person, not a photograph or video replay. Textract extracts identity document data (name, date of birth, document number, expiration, address) and verifies document authenticity through format validation and security feature detection.

**Document verification** - Textract processes supporting documents: proof of address (utility bills, bank statements), proof of income, and corporate documentation for business accounts. Extracted data is cross-referenced against the application data for consistency. Bedrock identifies discrepancies that warrant investigation.

**Risk screening** - Lambda functions orchestrate real-time screening against sanctions lists, PEP databases, and adverse media sources. SageMaker models assign customer risk levels based on the screening results, customer profile, product type, and geographic risk factors. Low-risk customers proceed through straight-through processing; high-risk customers are routed to enhanced due diligence.

**Suitability assessment** - For investment products, Bedrock conducts a conversational suitability assessment that gathers the customer's financial situation, investment objectives, risk tolerance, and experience. The assessment meets MiFID II requirements for suitability and appropriateness testing.

## Architecture

The customer-facing onboarding flow runs through a mobile or web application backed by API Gateway. Rekognition and Textract handle identity and document verification. Lambda functions orchestrate screening against external databases. SageMaker hosts the risk classification model. Bedrock powers the conversational suitability assessment. Approved applications are pushed to the core banking system for account creation. The entire flow is designed for completion in 5-10 minutes.

## Key Considerations

**Regulatory compliance** - Onboarding must comply with AML directives, data protection regulations (GDPR), and electronic identification regulations (eIDAS). AI-automated verification must meet the same legal standard as manual verification.

**Inclusion** - Identity verification must work across diverse populations. Facial recognition accuracy varies by skin tone, age, and identity document type. Regular testing across demographic groups is essential to avoid discriminatory barriers.

**Fraud prevention** - Onboarding is a prime target for identity fraud. Synthetic identities, stolen documents, and deepfakes must be detected. The system should incorporate multiple verification signals rather than relying on any single check.

**Cross-referencing** - Financial onboarding connects to customer onboarding in insurance, AML screening, credit scoring, and shares identity verification patterns with tenant screening in real estate and benefits eligibility in government.

## Next Steps

Map the current onboarding journey and identify the steps with highest abandonment and longest processing times. Pilot automated identity verification for the simplest account type (e.g., basic current account). Measure completion rates, processing times, and verification accuracy against the manual process. Expand to additional products and customer segments based on validated results.
