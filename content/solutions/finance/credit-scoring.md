Credit scoring determines who receives credit and at what price. Traditional scorecards use logistic regression on a limited set of features (payment history, outstanding debt, credit history length, credit utilization). While interpretable, these models leave predictive power on the table. AI credit scoring models capture non-linear relationships and interactions that improve default prediction by 15-25% while maintaining the explainability required by financial regulators.

## The Problem

Traditional credit scores misclassify a meaningful portion of applicants. Creditworthy borrowers with thin credit files (young adults, immigrants, people who prefer cash) are denied credit because the available data is insufficient for traditional models. Conversely, applicants who appear creditworthy based on historical factors may carry risks that traditional features do not capture. Each misclassification has a cost: false declines lose revenue and exclude potentially good customers; false approvals generate losses.

The global financial inclusion gap remains significant. An estimated 1.4 billion adults worldwide lack access to formal credit, often because traditional scoring methods cannot assess their risk.

## AI Approach

**Feature engineering** - SageMaker pipelines engineer features from diverse data sources beyond traditional bureau data: bank transaction patterns (income stability, spending behavior, savings habits), rental payment history, utility payments, and digital footprint signals where legally permissible. Redshift aggregates these data sources for model training.

**Gradient boosted models** - XGBoost or LightGBM models on SageMaker capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions that logistic regression misses. For example, the interaction between income stability and credit utilization may be more predictive than either feature alone. These models typically improve Gini coefficients by 5-10 points over traditional scorecards.

**Explainability** - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values provide feature-level explanations for each scoring decision. For each applicant, the system identifies which factors increased and decreased their score. Bedrock translates SHAP values into natural-language adverse action reasons that comply with regulatory requirements (e.g., "high credit utilization relative to income" rather than "feature_47 = -0.23").

**Monitoring and fairness** - Deployed models are monitored for performance degradation (increasing default rates at given score levels) and demographic fairness (equal opportunity and equalized odds across protected groups). SageMaker Model Monitor runs automated checks and alerts when metrics breach thresholds.

## Architecture

Applicant data flows from the loan origination system to the scoring pipeline via API Gateway. SageMaker real-time endpoints return scores and explanations within 200ms. Redshift stores the feature store and model monitoring data. Batch scoring for portfolio monitoring runs nightly. QuickSight dashboards track model performance metrics: KS statistic, Gini coefficient, population stability index, and fairness metrics.

## Key Considerations

**Regulatory compliance** - Credit scoring regulations (EU Consumer Credit Directive, national implementations) require the right to explanation for automated decisions. The model must provide specific, actionable reasons for adverse decisions. Regulators increasingly scrutinize AI models for fairness and transparency.

**Fair lending** - Models must not discriminate on prohibited grounds (race, gender, religion, national origin). Even if prohibited features are excluded, proxies (zip code, education) may create disparate impact. Regular disparate impact analysis is required, with remediation if significant disparities are detected.

**Model risk management** - Financial regulators require model risk management frameworks (SR 11-7 in the US, similar expectations in Europe). This includes independent model validation, ongoing monitoring, and documentation of model development and performance.

**Cross-referencing** - Credit scoring connects to customer onboarding in finance, underwriting automation in insurance, and tenant screening in real estate. The explainability and fairness techniques are applicable across all scoring applications.

## Next Steps

Benchmark the current scorecard's performance against a gradient boosted model on the same data. Quantify the improvement in discrimination (Gini), calibration, and the volume of thin-file applicants who could be scored. Implement explainability and fairness monitoring before any production deployment. Engage the model risk management function early in the development process.
