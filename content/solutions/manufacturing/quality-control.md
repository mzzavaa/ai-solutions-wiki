Visual inspection is one of the highest-volume, most repetitive tasks in manufacturing quality control. Human inspectors examining parts, assemblies, or finished products for defects are the norm across industries from electronics to food production. AI-powered computer vision automates this inspection with higher consistency and the ability to operate at line speed.

## The Quality Control Problem

Manual visual inspection has two fundamental limitations: human fatigue reduces accuracy over time, and human perception sets an upper bound on detection speed and consistency. Inspectors miss defects that fall below the perceptual threshold, inconsistently apply acceptance criteria across shifts, and cannot keep pace with high-speed production lines.

The cost of escaped defects - items that pass inspection but fail in the field - often significantly exceeds the cost of false positives (good parts incorrectly rejected). AI visual inspection addresses both: higher detection rates for real defects, and lower false positive rates through consistent criteria application.

## How It Works

**Image capture** - Industrial cameras positioned at inspection points capture images of each item, typically triggered by the production line's PLC system. Camera placement, lighting configuration, and image quality parameters are the most critical factors for system performance and are determined during installation.

**Defect detection** - A computer vision model processes each image and classifies whether the item is acceptable or defective. For more complex inspection tasks, the model identifies defect type and location in addition to binary pass/fail. Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels is a managed option for training custom defect detection models; SageMaker provides full control for more complex requirements.

**Line integration** - The detection result is communicated back to the production line in real time (typically sub-100ms per image): pass items continue; fail items are diverted to a rejection bin or halt the line. Integration with the line's PLC uses standard industrial protocols.

**Review and feedback** - Rejected items are physically reviewed by a quality engineer to confirm or overturn the AI decision. Confirmed decisions (especially overturns) are fed back into the training dataset to improve model accuracy over time.

## Training Data Requirements

Training a custom defect detection model requires labeled images: examples of both acceptable parts and parts with each defect type you need to detect. Collection requirements depend on defect type:

- Common defects with high natural occurrence rates: 200-500 examples per class may be sufficient
- Rare defects or subtle visual distinctions: 1,000+ examples typically needed
- Multiple defect types: labeled examples required for each class

Initial training data often comes from archival inspection images, supplemented by deliberately manufactured defects (samples with controlled defects introduced for training purposes).

## Performance Monitoring

Model performance in production degrades when the real-world distribution shifts from the training distribution: new product variants, different raw material batches, or equipment wear that changes part appearance. Monitor key metrics continuously:

- **Escape rate** - Defects not caught by the AI (detected by downstream inspection or field failures)
- **False positive rate** - Good parts incorrectly rejected
- **Confidence distribution** - If the distribution of model confidence scores shifts over time, the model may be encountering inputs increasingly unlike its training data

Retrain when escape rate or false positive rate exceeds acceptable thresholds. Automated drift detection with SageMaker Model Monitor reduces the manual monitoring burden.

## Integration Considerations

Production line integration requires close coordination between AI engineers and the plant's automation and controls team. Line speed, camera trigger timing, latency requirements, and the rejection mechanism all require joint specification. Start with a pilot at reduced line speed, validate performance at scale, then expand.
