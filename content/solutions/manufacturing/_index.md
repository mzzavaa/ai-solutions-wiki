Manufacturing AI applications concentrate on two categories of value: reducing unplanned downtime and improving yield. Unplanned downtime costs industrial manufacturers an estimated $50B/year globally (ARC Advisory Group). Yield losses from defects, scrap, and rework are the second-largest cost after materials. Both are addressable with sensor data, computer vision, and ML — typically without replacing existing equipment.

## Solution Areas

**[Defect Detection](defect-detection/)** — Inspect products on the production line using computer vision cameras and ML classifiers trained on images of good and defective parts. Automated optical inspection (AOI) systems catch surface defects, dimensional deviations, and assembly errors that manual inspection misses or catches too late. Typical deployment: line-side cameras feeding edge inference hardware with sub-100ms latency.

**[Predictive Maintenance](predictive-maintenance-ai/)** — Predict equipment failures before they occur by analyzing vibration, temperature, pressure, and current sensor data. Models learn the normal operating signature of each machine and alert when anomalous patterns emerge. Reduces unplanned downtime and enables condition-based maintenance scheduling rather than time-based servicing.

**[Quality Control](quality-control/)** — Statistical process control enhanced with ML: detect process drift earlier than traditional SPC charts, identify which process parameters drive yield variation, and recommend corrective actions. Connects inspection data to upstream process data to close the cause-effect loop.

**[Digital Twin](digital-twin/)** — Build a simulation model of a production system calibrated to real operational data. Use the twin to test scheduling changes, maintenance interventions, and capacity expansions before applying them to the physical system. Physics-based and data-driven twins are often combined.

**[Production Scheduling](production-scheduling/)** — Optimize job sequencing, machine allocation, and shift scheduling given capacity constraints, due dates, and setup times. Reinforcement learning and mixed-integer programming approaches both apply; RL is increasingly competitive for complex dynamic scheduling problems.

**[Supply Chain Optimization](supply-chain-optimization/)** — Optimize raw material procurement, inventory positioning, and supplier selection using demand signals from the production plan. AI models flag supplier risk and recommend dual-sourcing or buffer stock decisions before disruptions materialize.
