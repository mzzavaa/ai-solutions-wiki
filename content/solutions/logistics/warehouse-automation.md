Warehouses are the operational heart of supply chains, and labor is their largest cost - typically 50-65% of total warehouse operating expense. AI optimizes warehouse operations at multiple levels: where to store products (slotting), how to sequence picks (path optimization), how many workers to schedule (labor planning), and how to coordinate human workers with automated systems (robotic orchestration).

## The Problem

Traditional warehouse management relies on simple rules: store products in fixed locations, pick in the order received, schedule labor based on average volumes. These rules do not adapt to changing demand patterns, seasonal shifts, or product mix evolution. The result is excessive travel time (pickers walk 10-15 km per shift in large warehouses), labor misallocation (overstaffed during slow periods, understaffed during peaks), and poor space utilization.

E-commerce has intensified these challenges. Order profiles have shifted from pallets and cases to individual items ("each picks"), increasing the number of picks per order and the variability of demand.

## AI Approach

**Dynamic slotting** - SageMaker models analyze order patterns, product velocity, and physical product characteristics to determine optimal storage locations. High-velocity items are placed in ergonomic, easily accessible locations. Products frequently ordered together are placed near each other to minimize travel. Slotting recommendations are regenerated weekly as demand patterns shift.

**Pick path optimization** - Given a batch of orders, the system groups orders into efficient pick waves and generates optimal pick paths that minimize travel distance. The optimization considers aisle layout, picker capacity (cart size, weight limits), and order priority. For goods-to-person systems, the optimization determines which storage units to retrieve and in what sequence.

**Demand-based labor scheduling** - Amazon Forecast predicts hourly workload by warehouse function (receiving, putaway, picking, packing, shipping). SageMaker models convert workload forecasts into staffing requirements by role and skill level. Schedules are generated 2 weeks in advance for permanent staff and adjusted daily for temporary labor.

**Robotic coordination** - AWS RoboMaker supports autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) that assist pickers by transporting totes or delivering products. AI coordination assigns tasks to robots, manages traffic in aisle intersections, and balances workload across the robot fleet. Human-robot collaboration models determine which tasks are best performed by humans, robots, or combinations.

## Architecture

Order data, inventory positions, and warehouse layout data flow from the WMS (Warehouse Management System) into the optimization pipeline. SageMaker runs slotting optimization weekly, pick path optimization per wave, and labor forecasting daily. Forecast provides the demand predictions that drive labor scheduling. RoboMaker manages the robot fleet. Optimized instructions are pushed to WMS, handheld devices, and robot controllers.

## Key Considerations

**Implementation sequencing** - Start with slotting optimization (high impact, no hardware required) before investing in robotic automation. Measure the travel time reduction from better slotting to build the business case for further automation.

**System integration** - Warehouse optimization requires tight integration with the WMS. API reliability and data latency directly affect operational performance. Real-time inventory accuracy is a prerequisite.

**Change management** - Warehouse workers need training and clear communication when workflows change. Gradual rollout with worker feedback loops improves adoption and surfaces practical issues.

**Cross-referencing** - Warehouse automation connects to inventory management in retail, route optimization in logistics (warehouse operations affect dispatch timing), and demand forecasting for labor planning.

## Next Steps

Analyze current warehouse performance: picks per hour, travel time per pick, labor utilization, and order accuracy. Identify the largest opportunity area (typically slotting or labor scheduling). Implement the optimization for one zone or shift as a pilot. Measure picks per hour and travel distance improvements to quantify the value before expanding.
