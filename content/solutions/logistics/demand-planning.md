Logistics demand planning forecasts the volume of goods that will flow through the distribution network, driving decisions about capacity, staffing, equipment, and carrier procurement. Unlike retail demand forecasting (which predicts end-consumer demand), logistics demand planning focuses on shipment volumes, handling requirements, and network capacity at each node and lane.

## The Problem

Logistics providers and shippers face demand variability across multiple dimensions: daily, weekly, and seasonal patterns, promotional spikes from retail customers, economic cycles, and unpredictable events. Under-forecasting leads to capacity shortages (delayed shipments, premium freight costs, customer penalties). Over-forecasting leads to excess capacity costs (idle warehouse space, underutilized vehicles, overstaffed facilities).

The challenge is compounded by the bullwhip effect: small demand fluctuations at the retail level amplify into larger swings upstream in the supply chain. A 10% increase in consumer demand can translate to a 30-40% demand spike at the logistics provider level as retailers and distributors over-order to build safety stock.

## AI Approach

**Multi-level volume forecasting** - Amazon Forecast generates demand projections at multiple granularities: lane level (origin-destination pair), facility level (total inbound and outbound), and service level (express, standard, freight). Hierarchical reconciliation ensures consistency across levels. The model incorporates seasonal patterns, economic indicators, customer order pipeline data, and historical promotional impacts.

**Capacity planning** - SageMaker models convert volume forecasts into capacity requirements: warehouse labor hours, vehicle requirements by type, dock door utilization, and handling equipment needs. The conversion accounts for productivity rates, vehicle capacity utilization, and facility constraints. Gap analysis identifies periods where forecasted demand exceeds available capacity.

**Carrier procurement optimization** - For shippers using third-party carriers, demand forecasts inform procurement strategy. Baseload volume is committed to contracted carriers at favorable rates; variable volume is allocated to spot market carriers. The optimization balances rate certainty against flexibility, using demand forecast confidence intervals to set optimal contract volumes.

**Scenario planning** - Bedrock generates demand scenarios based on macroeconomic projections, customer growth plans, and market intelligence. Each scenario produces capacity and cost implications, enabling proactive planning for a range of outcomes rather than optimizing for a single forecast.

## Architecture

Shipment history, customer data, and economic indicators flow into Redshift. Amazon Forecast generates volume projections across the network. SageMaker models convert volumes to capacity requirements. Scenario analysis results are presented through QuickSight dashboards. Capacity plans are exported to operational planning systems for execution.

## Key Considerations

**Customer collaboration** - The best demand visibility comes from customers sharing their own forecasts and order pipelines. Incentivizing information sharing through collaborative planning agreements improves forecast accuracy for both parties.

**Forecast granularity** - Total network volume may be forecasted accurately even when lane-level forecasts are poor. Plan at the level where forecast accuracy is sufficient for the decision being made.

**Lead time alignment** - Different capacity decisions have different lead times: hiring requires weeks, vehicle leasing requires months, facility expansion requires years. The forecast horizon must align with the decision lead time.

**Cross-referencing** - Logistics demand planning connects to demand forecasting in retail (downstream demand drives logistics volumes), supply chain optimization in manufacturing, fleet management, and warehouse automation for labor planning.

## Next Steps

Aggregate historical shipment data by the relevant planning dimensions (lane, facility, service type). Build baseline forecasting models and measure accuracy. Identify the capacity decisions with the highest cost of forecast error and focus improvement efforts there. Pilot collaborative forecasting with the top 5 customers to test the value of demand signal sharing.
