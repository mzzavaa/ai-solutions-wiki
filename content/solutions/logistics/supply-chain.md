Supply chain operations generate enormous amounts of data and operate with narrow margins for error. AI improves supply chain performance primarily through better forecasting (predicting what will be needed, when, and where) and better optimization (finding more efficient paths, inventory levels, and resource allocations given real-world constraints).

## Demand Forecasting

Demand forecasting - predicting future customer demand to inform production, procurement, and inventory decisions - is where AI delivers the clearest ROI in supply chain applications.

**Traditional approaches** fail when demand patterns are non-stationary, affected by external factors (weather, events, economic indicators), or too granular (thousands of SKU-location combinations) for manual management.

**ML-based forecasting** handles these challenges through:
- Learning complex seasonal patterns and trend interactions
- Incorporating external signals (weather forecasts, economic indicators, competitive activity) as model features
- Scaling to thousands of product-location combinations with a single model
- Producing probabilistic forecasts (10th/50th/90th percentile predictions) that inform safety stock calculations

Amazon Forecast is a managed service for time-series demand forecasting that handles feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. For organizations with specialized requirements or existing ML infrastructure, SageMaker with custom AutoML or forecasting libraries (Prophet, NeuralForecast) provides more flexibility.

## Inventory Optimization

Better demand forecasts directly enable better inventory decisions, but translating forecasts into optimal inventory levels requires optimization logic:

- **Safety stock calculation** - Based on demand variability (from probabilistic forecast) and lead time variability, calculate the safety stock needed to achieve target service levels at each location
- **Reorder point and quantity** - Determine when to order and how much, balancing holding costs against stockout risk
- **Multi-echelon optimization** - For networks with distribution centers and stores, allocate inventory across the network to minimize total system inventory while meeting local service levels

These calculations update daily or weekly as new demand signals arrive, replacing static rules set months earlier with dynamic parameters that respond to changing conditions.

## Route Optimization

Route optimization for last-mile delivery and middle-mile transport moves significant needle on logistics cost:

- **Vehicle routing** - Assign delivery stops to vehicles and sequence routes to minimize total distance or time, given vehicle capacity, time window, and driver availability constraints
- **Dynamic routing** - Adjust routes in real time as new orders arrive, traffic conditions change, or delays occur
- **Fleet mix optimization** - Determine the optimal combination of owned fleet and third-party carriers for a given demand forecast

Constraint-based optimization algorithms (often combined with ML for demand estimation) handle vehicle routing. AWS has native integrations with third-party routing platforms; for custom implementations, SageMaker with optimization libraries is a path.

## Disruption Detection

Supply chain disruptions - supplier delays, port congestion, geopolitical events, weather - are costly precisely because they are discovered late. AI-based disruption detection monitors signals continuously:

- Supplier news and regulatory filings for early warning signals
- Port congestion data and shipping lane conditions
- Weather forecasts overlaid on supply network geography
- Supplier financial health indicators

LLM-based analysis of unstructured news and regulatory text surfaces supply chain risk signals before they appear in structured data feeds. This is an emerging application area with meaningful early adopter advantage.
