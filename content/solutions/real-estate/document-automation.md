Real estate transactions generate substantial paperwork: purchase agreements, leases, title documents, property disclosures, inspection reports, and closing documents. Much of this documentation follows standard templates with transaction-specific variations. AI document automation reduces preparation time, ensures completeness, and extracts structured data from legacy documents for portfolio management.

## The Problem

Property management companies handling hundreds or thousands of leases spend significant time on document preparation, renewal processing, and data extraction. Each lease contains unique terms (rent, escalation clauses, maintenance responsibilities, renewal options) that must be tracked and acted upon. Manually extracting these terms from existing leases into management systems is error-prone and time-consuming.

Transaction-side document preparation involves populating templates with deal-specific information, ensuring completeness against jurisdictional requirements, and coordinating multiple documents that must be consistent with each other. Errors in document preparation cause closing delays, legal liability, and customer dissatisfaction.

## AI Approach

**Document generation** - Bedrock generates transaction documents from structured deal data and approved templates. The system populates standard clauses, selects jurisdiction-appropriate language, and flags terms that deviate from standard practice for human review. Generated documents are compared against completeness checklists to ensure all required provisions are included.

**Lease abstraction** - For existing lease portfolios, Textract extracts text from scanned and digital lease documents. Bedrock then identifies and extracts key terms: parties, premises, rent amounts, escalation schedules, renewal options, termination provisions, and maintenance obligations. Extracted data populates the property management system, creating a structured, searchable lease database.

**Document review** - Incoming documents (counterparty leases, vendor contracts, title commitments) are analyzed for non-standard terms, missing provisions, and potential risks. The system flags deviations from the organization's standard terms and identifies clauses that require legal review.

**Compliance checking** - Each document is checked against jurisdictional requirements: required disclosures (lead paint, flood zone, HOA), mandated lease provisions (security deposit limits, notice requirements), and regulatory filings. Missing compliance elements are flagged before execution.

## Architecture

Document templates and standard clause libraries are stored in S3. Deal data flows from the CRM or property management system to trigger document generation via Lambda. Bedrock handles generation, extraction, and review tasks. Textract processes scanned documents. Generated and reviewed documents are stored in S3 with metadata in DynamoDB. A document management interface allows users to review AI outputs, make edits, and approve final versions.

## Key Considerations

**Template governance** - Document templates must be maintained by legal counsel. AI generation operates within approved templates, not by creating novel legal language. Template updates should be version-controlled and reviewed before deployment.

**Extraction accuracy validation** - Lease abstraction from legacy documents requires validation. Deploy with human review of all extracted terms for the first batch, then transition to exception-based review once accuracy is established above 95%.

**Jurisdictional complexity** - Real estate law varies significantly by jurisdiction. The system must be configured with jurisdiction-specific requirements and templates. Cross-jurisdictional portfolios require jurisdiction detection and appropriate template selection.

**Cross-referencing** - Document automation in real estate shares patterns with contract analysis in legal and policy document processing in insurance. The same extraction and generation approaches apply across document-heavy industries.

## Next Steps

Start with lease abstraction for the existing portfolio - this creates immediate value by building a structured lease database without changing current document preparation processes. Use the abstracted data to identify upcoming renewal dates, expiring options, and non-standard terms that need attention. Expand to document generation once the template library and compliance rules are established.
