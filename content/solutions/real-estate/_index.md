Real estate AI applications cluster around three workflows: valuation (pricing accuracy and speed), transactions (document processing and compliance), and tenant/buyer experience (lead qualification, self-service). The industry handles high document volumes under regulatory constraint — contracts, disclosures, title documents, and inspection reports — making NLP and document extraction high-value applications. Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) are the most established application; Zillow's Zestimate and lender-grade AVMs from CoreLogic and Black Knight have operated at scale for over a decade. Fair housing law (Fair Housing Act in the US, Equality Act in the UK) constrains how demographic or geographic variables can be used in screening and pricing models.

## Solution Areas

**[Property Valuation](property-valuation/)** — Estimate property market value using comparable sales (comps), property characteristics, location features, and market trend data. Automated Valuation Models (AVMs) use gradient boosting or neural network architectures trained on MLS transaction data and assessor records. Lender-grade AVM accuracy (within 10% of sale price) is achievable at metropolitan scale; accuracy degrades for unique properties and thin-transaction markets.

**[Document Automation](document-automation/)** — Extract, classify, and validate information from purchase contracts, lease agreements, title commitments, and disclosure documents. NLP models identify key terms, dates, conditions, and obligations. Reduces attorney and paralegal review time for routine transactions. Flags non-standard clauses for legal review rather than automating legal judgment.

**[Lead Scoring](lead-scoring/)** — Rank and prioritize inbound buyer and seller leads by predicted conversion probability using behavioral signals (search patterns, property saves, inquiry content) and demographic proxies. Allows agents and inside sales teams to focus outreach on highest-value leads. Model features must be reviewed against Fair Housing Act constraints on protected class proxies.

**[Market Analysis](market-analysis/)** — Forecast price trends, absorption rates, and supply-demand dynamics at ZIP code or neighborhood granularity. Models incorporate listing data, transaction history, permit activity, employment trends, and migration patterns. Supports investment underwriting, development feasibility, and portfolio management decisions.

**[Tenant Screening](tenant-screening/)** — Evaluate rental applicants using credit history, income verification, rental history, and eviction records. AI models score applicants against owner-defined criteria. Fair Housing Act and state-level source-of-income protections constrain which factors can be used and how adverse action notices must be provided.

**[Virtual Staging](virtual-staging/)** — Generate photorealistic furnished images of empty properties using generative AI and 3D rendering. Replaces physical staging for vacant listings at a fraction of the cost. Reduces days-on-market for unfurnished inventory and enables remote buyers to visualize space use.

**[Tenant Support](tenant-support/)** — Provide tenants with 24/7 access to maintenance request submission, lease information, and payment assistance through AI chat interfaces. Routes complex requests to property management staff. Reduces inbound call volume and improves response time visibility for tenants.
