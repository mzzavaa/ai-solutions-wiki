Real estate agents receive leads from multiple sources - web inquiries, portal listings, referrals, open houses, social media - but only 2-5% of leads convert to transactions. Agents who spend equal time on all leads burn effort on low-intent prospects while high-intent buyers go unattended. AI lead scoring prioritizes leads by predicted conversion probability, enabling agents to focus on the prospects most likely to transact.

## The Problem

Lead volume exceeds agent capacity. A busy agent may receive 50-100 new leads per month but can effectively nurture only 15-20 active relationships. Without prioritization, agents rely on gut instinct or first-come-first-served ordering, which correlates poorly with actual conversion potential. High-intent leads that arrive during busy periods may receive delayed responses, reducing conversion rates.

The information available at lead creation varies: a web inquiry might include only a name and email, while an open house registration includes property interest, timeline, and prequalification status. Scoring must work across these varying information levels and improve as more data becomes available.

## AI Approach

**Behavioral scoring** - SageMaker models analyze digital engagement signals: number and recency of property views, search frequency and consistency, price range stability (narrowing price range indicates increasing seriousness), geographic focus, and response to communications. Each behavior is weighted based on its historical correlation with conversion.

**Demographic and financial signals** - Where available, financial prequalification status, employment stability, current housing situation (renter vs. owner), and life event indicators (job change, growing family) provide context. These features are combined with behavioral signals in a gradient boosted model that outputs a conversion probability.

**Time-decay scoring** - Lead scores are updated continuously as new behavioral data arrives. A lead that was highly scored last month but has gone silent should decline in priority. DynamoDB stores the event stream per lead, and Lambda functions recalculate scores on each significant event.

**Nurture optimization** - For leads scored below the threshold for immediate agent attention, Amazon Personalize drives automated nurture campaigns: property recommendations matching the lead's demonstrated preferences, market update emails, and re-engagement triggers when the lead's behavior resumes.

## Architecture

Lead data from the CRM, website analytics, listing portals, and communication systems flows into the scoring pipeline. SageMaker models score leads in near-real-time via Lambda triggers on new events. Scores are written to DynamoDB and pushed to the CRM as a priority field. Personalize drives automated nurture sequences for lower-scored leads. QuickSight dashboards track conversion rates by score band and lead source to validate model performance.

## Key Considerations

**Score transparency** - Agents adopt scoring systems they trust. Display the key factors driving each lead's score (e.g., "viewed 15 properties this week, narrowed search to 2 neighborhoods, opened last 3 emails") rather than just a number.

**Feedback loop** - Agent dispositions (converted, lost, nurture) provide training labels. The model improves as agents consistently record outcomes. Without outcome data, the model cannot learn.

**Lead source calibration** - Conversion rates vary dramatically by source (referrals convert 5-10x higher than portal leads). The model should account for source-specific baselines to avoid unfairly penalizing certain lead types.

**Cross-referencing** - Lead scoring shares patterns with customer segmentation in retail and customer onboarding scoring in finance and insurance. Market analysis signals can inform lead scoring by identifying leads in heating markets.

## Next Steps

Analyze historical lead-to-conversion data to identify the behavioral and demographic features most predictive of conversion. Build a baseline model and validate against held-out historical leads. Deploy scoring alongside the existing CRM workflow, providing scores as advisory information to agents. Measure agent adoption and conversion rate improvement over a 6-month pilot period.
