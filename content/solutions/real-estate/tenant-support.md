Property managers handling dozens or hundreds of units spend a disproportionate share of their time on the operational mechanics of tenant support: receiving repair requests, triaging urgency, contacting vendors, scheduling, and communicating status back to tenants. AI automation handles this operational layer consistently without requiring the property manager's direct involvement for routine issues.

## Repair Request Intake

Tenants submit repair requests through a web form, SMS, or email. The intake assistant processes each submission regardless of channel, converting unstructured descriptions into structured tickets.

Extraction pulls: the reported issue type, location within the unit, urgency indicators (water is actively leaking vs. a slow drip vs. a past leak), whether the tenant will be present to provide access, and preferred contact method for scheduling.

Natural language descriptions are normalized into standard issue categories (plumbing, HVAC, electrical, appliance, structural) that drive vendor routing. "The kitchen sink won't drain and there's water under the cabinet" becomes category: plumbing, urgency: high, location: kitchen.

## Urgency Triage

Urgency classification determines response time requirements. The classification rules are configured by the property management company:

- **Emergency** (respond within 2-4 hours): active water leak, no heat in winter, gas smell, electrical hazard, security breach
- **Urgent** (respond within 24 hours): HVAC not functioning, hot water outage, major appliance failure
- **Routine** (respond within 3-5 business days): minor repairs, cosmetic issues, non-critical appliance problems

Emergency tickets trigger immediate notification to the on-call property manager and the primary vendor for that category. Routine tickets queue for the next vendor scheduling cycle.

## Vendor Coordination

The vendor roster is managed in the system with each vendor's categories, service areas, availability windows, and current workload. When a ticket is created, the assignment engine matches it to available vendors in the right category for the property location.

For routine work, the system sends availability requests to the top two or three vendor candidates and books the first to confirm. For emergencies, it contacts vendors in priority order with escalation to backup vendors if primary contacts do not respond within a defined window.

Vendor confirmations, rescheduling requests, and job completion notifications all flow through the system. The property manager sees a current status view for all open tickets without needing to chase individual vendors.

## Tenant Communication

Tenants receive automated status updates at each stage: request received, vendor assigned, appointment scheduled, job completed. The messaging is configured per property company - consistent with whatever tone and branding the company uses.

For complex jobs that require multiple visits or parts ordering, the assistant sends interim status updates rather than leaving the tenant with no information. Tenants who feel informed are significantly less likely to escalate complaints or submit duplicate requests.

## Reporting

Monthly reports cover ticket volume by category, average time to resolution, vendor performance, and recurring issues by property or unit. Recurring issues in the same unit or building (third plumbing ticket in unit 4B in 6 months) surface for proactive maintenance review.
