An AI claims assistant handles the high-volume, document-heavy phases of claims processing so adjusters can focus on judgment-intensive decisions. The system does not replace adjusters - it does the intake, evidence gathering, and pre-screening work that currently consumes most of their time before a real decision is even made.

## What Goes In

Each claim submitted to the assistant carries four input types:

- **Claim form** - the structured or semi-structured initial submission, whether filed via web form, PDF, or email
- **Policy document** - the active policy associated with the claimant, used to verify coverage and applicable limits
- **Photos and supporting media** - damage photographs, scene images, or supporting attachments
- **Repair or medical estimates** - third-party assessments of damage or treatment costs

The system accepts all of these through a single intake endpoint. Documents are stored in S3 and a claim record is created immediately so the claimant receives confirmation of receipt regardless of processing status.

## Processing Steps

**Intake normalization** - The claim form is parsed and converted into a structured data record. Required fields are checked against the claim type. Missing fields are identified immediately and a data-gathering request is issued to the claimant before any processing continues.

**Policy matching and coverage check** - The policy document is matched against the claim type and the reported loss date. Coverage gaps, exclusions, or limit constraints are flagged at this stage - before the adjuster touches the file.

**Document extraction** - Textract processes photos and estimates to extract structured information: damage categories, line-item costs, location data from image metadata. Bedrock post-processes the extracted text to resolve ambiguities and normalize against claim categories.

**Fraud signal detection** - Rule-based checks run first: claim amount relative to policy age, estimate amounts relative to historical averages for the reported damage type, claimant contact details cross-referenced against known patterns. ML-based anomaly scoring runs in parallel. Any triggered signal generates a flag with the specific signal described - not just a score.

**Evidence bundle assembly** - All extracted data, documents, flags, and coverage notes are assembled into a single structured evidence bundle. The adjuster receives this rather than a folder of raw files.

**Payout recommendation** - Based on extracted costs, coverage limits, and completeness of documentation, the system generates a recommended settlement range with the basis for that range stated explicitly.

## What Comes Out

- **Claim summary** - structured one-page overview of the claim, claimant, coverage status, and key facts
- **Evidence bundle** - organized set of extracted data from all submitted documents, with confidence scores where relevant
- **Payout recommendation** - a settlement range with supporting rationale, not a final decision

## Human Adjuster Sign-Off

The payout recommendation is advisory. The adjuster reviews the summary, checks the evidence bundle, and either accepts, modifies, or overrides the recommendation. The final authorization is always a human action. For complex or high-value claims, the system routes directly to a senior adjuster queue with the fraud flags prominently surfaced.

This design satisfies regulatory requirements in most jurisdictions - automated screening and recommendation is permitted, but automated approval of payment is not. Audit logs from Step Functions capture every state transition and decision for the required retention period.

## Typical Results

Claims processed through an intake assistant typically show 40-60% reduction in time from FNOL to adjuster review, primarily because document chasing and manual data entry are eliminated. Fraud flag precision varies by domain but typically surfaces 2-5x more potential anomalies than manual review alone, at lower false-positive rates when the signal rules are properly calibrated.
