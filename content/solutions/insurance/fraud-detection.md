Insurance fraud accounts for an estimated 5-10% of total claims costs across the industry. Organized fraud rings, opportunistic claim inflation, and staged events collectively cost European insurers billions annually. Traditional fraud detection relies on red flag rules and investigator intuition, catching only 10-20% of fraudulent claims. AI detection identifies subtle patterns across claims, claimants, and provider networks that manual methods miss.

## The Problem

Fraud detection faces a fundamental tension: thoroughness versus customer experience. Investigating every claim delays legitimate payments and damages customer relationships. Investigating too few claims allows fraud to proliferate. Rule-based detection generates high false positive rates (80-90% of flagged claims are ultimately legitimate) because the rules must be sensitive enough to catch fraud at the cost of flagging many legitimate claims.

Organized fraud is particularly challenging. Fraud rings coordinate staged accidents, phantom injuries, and complicit service providers. The individual claims may appear legitimate in isolation; the fraud pattern is visible only when relationships between claimants, witnesses, providers, and incidents are analyzed as a network.

## AI Approach

**Claims scoring** - SageMaker models score each claim at submission for fraud probability based on claim characteristics, claimant history, provider patterns, and contextual factors. Features include: time between incident and reporting, claim amount relative to policy history, provider billing patterns, injury severity relative to incident description, and historical fraud indicators for the claimant.

**Network analysis** - Amazon Neptune stores the network of relationships between claimants, policies, addresses, phone numbers, vehicles, medical providers, legal representatives, and repair shops. Graph analytics identify clusters of interconnected entities that appear in multiple claims - a hallmark of organized fraud. Shared addresses, phone numbers, or providers across otherwise unrelated claims trigger investigation.

**Image and document forensics** - Computer vision models analyze claim photos (vehicle damage, property damage, injury documentation) for manipulation: metadata inconsistencies, image editing artifacts, photos recycled from previous claims or the internet, and damage inconsistent with the described incident.

**Behavioral analytics** - Bedrock analyzes claim narratives for linguistic indicators of deception: inconsistencies between the written description and structured claim data, language patterns associated with rehearsed statements, and changes in narrative across multiple communications.

## Architecture

Claims data flows from the claims management system into the fraud detection pipeline. SageMaker scores each claim in real time at first notice of loss. Neptune maintains the entity network, updated with each new claim. High-scored claims are enriched with network analysis results and image forensic findings. Bedrock generates investigation summaries that present the fraud indicators and evidence to the Special Investigations Unit (SIU). Investigation outcomes feed back into model retraining.

## Key Considerations

**False positive management** - The cost of investigating a false positive includes operational cost, claims delay, and customer relationship damage. Optimize the detection threshold to balance fraud savings against investigation costs and customer impact.

**Evolving tactics** - Fraud tactics evolve in response to detection. Models must be retrained regularly on recent confirmed fraud cases. Adversarial monitoring should track whether detection rates are declining, which may indicate that fraudsters have adapted to the current model.

**Regulatory requirements** - Some jurisdictions require insurers to maintain fraud detection programs and report suspected fraud to authorities. The system should support these reporting requirements with structured case files.

**Cross-referencing** - Insurance fraud detection shares patterns with fraud detection in finance, anti-money-laundering systems, and tax fraud detection in government. Network analysis techniques are applicable across all these domains.

## Next Steps

Analyze the current fraud detection funnel: how many claims are flagged, investigated, and confirmed as fraud. Identify the claim types with the highest fraud incidence. Build a scoring model for the highest-impact claim type and deploy alongside existing detection rules. Measure the incremental fraud detection rate and false positive reduction compared to rules alone.
