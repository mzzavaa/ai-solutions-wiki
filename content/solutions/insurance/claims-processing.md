Insurance claims processing is one of the clearest AI automation opportunities in financial services. The workflow is well-defined, the inputs are primarily documents, the decision logic is partially formalizable, and the volume is high enough that small efficiency gains compound into significant cost savings. The challenge is not identifying where AI helps - it is sequencing the implementation so that automation delivers value without introducing compliance or quality risks.

## The Claims Processing Workflow

A standard property or casualty claim moves through several stages: first notice of loss (FNOL), document collection, assessment, fraud review, decision, and payment or denial. Each stage has distinct AI automation opportunities.

**FNOL and intake** - Claims arrive through multiple channels: web forms, email, scanned paper. AI can standardize intake by extracting structured data from unstructured inputs and routing to the correct queue. A claim with clear documentation and low complexity routes to automated fast-track processing. A claim with missing documents or anomalies routes to a claims handler with a pre-populated dossier.

**Document extraction** - Most claims involve 3-10 documents: police reports, medical records, repair estimates, photos. Amazon Textract extracts text, tables, and form fields from all of these. For standardized forms (claim forms, specific medical billing formats), Textract's query-based extraction returns specific fields with high accuracy. For freeform documents, Bedrock post-processing converts raw text into structured JSON.

**Fraud detection** - Fraud patterns often appear at the data level before they are visible to a human reviewer. AI-assisted fraud screening checks for: claim amount anomalies relative to historical patterns for similar events; claimant history patterns; cross-claim linkage (same witnesses, contractors, or medical providers appearing across multiple unrelated claims); timing patterns. This is a flagging system, not an automated denial system. Flagged claims route to a specialist reviewer with the specific anomalies highlighted.

**Risk scoring** - Before final decision, a risk score combines claim complexity, documentation completeness, fraud flag status, and estimated settlement value. This score drives queue prioritization and determines whether the claim requires senior adjuster review.

## Technical Architecture

The Step Functions workflow orchestrates the full pipeline. Key states:

1. Intake handler - receives claim, stores documents in S3, creates claim record in the system of record
2. Document processor - invokes Textract for each document asynchronously, waits for completion
3. Data extractor - Bedrock call to structure extracted text, resolve entity references, validate required fields
4. Fraud screening - Lambda function applies rule-based checks plus a SageMaker endpoint for ML-based anomaly scoring
5. Routing decision - based on extracted data and scores, routes to fast-track or human review queue
6. Human review task token - for routed claims, Step Functions pauses and waits for the claims handler to complete their review and submit a decision
7. Payment or denial - triggers downstream payment systems or generates denial letter

## Compliance Considerations

Automated claims decisions require explainability. Any claim denied based on AI scoring needs a human reviewer sign-off and a documented rationale, both for regulatory compliance and for handling disputes. The architecture above maintains this: AI scores and flags, but authorization gates remain human-controlled. This is the correct design for any regulated financial decision workflow.

Audit logs are generated automatically by Step Functions and should be retained per your jurisdiction's requirements (typically 7-10 years for insurance records).
