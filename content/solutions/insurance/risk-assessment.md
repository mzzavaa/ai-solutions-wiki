Insurance risk assessment determines the expected cost of insuring a risk. Traditional actuarial methods use broad rating factors (age, location, property type) that group dissimilar risks together. AI risk assessment incorporates granular data - telematics, IoT sensors, satellite imagery, behavioral signals - to differentiate risk at the individual level, enabling more accurate pricing and better portfolio management.

## The Problem

Traditional rating factors are proxies. Age correlates with driving risk, but a cautious 20-year-old is a better risk than a reckless 40-year-old. Property location correlates with flood risk, but two adjacent properties may have dramatically different risk profiles based on elevation, drainage, and construction. When pricing is based on proxies, low-risk individuals within a group subsidize high-risk individuals, creating adverse selection pressure.

The result: insurers with crude risk assessment lose profitable customers to competitors who price more accurately, while retaining the high-risk customers who are underpriced - a cycle that degrades portfolio profitability.

## AI Approach

**Telematics-based motor risk** - For auto insurance, telematics devices and smartphone apps capture driving behavior: speed, acceleration, braking, cornering, time of driving, and route risk. SageMaker models trained on telematics data combined with claims history predict individual accident probability with 2-3x the accuracy of traditional rating factors. Kinesis ingests real-time telematics streams for continuous risk monitoring.

**IoT-enabled property risk** - Smart home sensors (water leak detectors, smoke alarms, security systems) provide real-time property condition data. Properties with active monitoring have 30-50% fewer water damage and fire claims. The risk model incorporates sensor presence and alert history as rating factors, rewarding proactive risk management with lower premiums.

**Satellite and aerial imagery** - Computer vision models analyze satellite imagery to assess property risk factors: roof condition, vegetation proximity, pool presence, and construction quality. This data supplements or replaces physical inspections for property insurance underwriting.

**Catastrophe modeling** - SageMaker models integrate climate data, historical event patterns, and property exposure data to estimate catastrophe risk at granular geographic levels. The output feeds pricing, reinsurance purchasing, and accumulation management decisions. Redshift stores the large-scale exposure and loss simulation datasets.

## Architecture

Data streams from telematics devices, IoT sensors, and satellite imagery providers flow through Kinesis into S3. SageMaker batch and real-time pipelines process this data into risk features. Risk models are trained on the combined feature set and claims outcome data stored in Redshift. Model outputs feed the rating engine, portfolio analytics dashboards in QuickSight, and catastrophe accumulation monitoring systems.

## Key Considerations

**Data privacy and consent** - Telematics and IoT data collection requires explicit customer consent and transparent data use policies. GDPR and national data protection laws apply to personal data collected through monitoring devices.

**Regulatory acceptance** - Some rating factors derived from AI may not be permissible in all jurisdictions. The use of non-traditional data sources in pricing must be validated against regulatory requirements before deployment.

**Model validation** - Actuarial standards require rigorous model validation, including out-of-sample testing, sensitivity analysis, and documentation of assumptions. AI models used in reserving and pricing must meet these standards.

**Cross-referencing** - Risk assessment connects to underwriting automation, fraud detection (claims patterns inform risk models), and shares patterns with predictive maintenance in manufacturing and energy (IoT-based risk monitoring).

## Next Steps

Identify the product line where traditional rating factors perform worst (highest loss ratio variability within rating segments). Source alternative data for that product line - telematics for auto, satellite imagery for property, wearable data for health. Build and validate a model incorporating the new data sources. Measure improvement in loss ratio prediction accuracy before integrating with the rating engine.
