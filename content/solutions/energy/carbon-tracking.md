Carbon emissions reporting is transitioning from voluntary to mandatory across Europe. The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) requires detailed emissions disclosure, and the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) imposes carbon costs on imports. Organizations need accurate, auditable emissions data across their operations and supply chains. AI automates the complex data collection, calculation, and reporting required for comprehensive emissions management.

## The Problem

Carbon emissions accounting requires tracking energy consumption, fuel use, industrial processes, transportation, waste, and purchased goods across the entire organization and its value chain. Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (purchased energy) emissions are relatively straightforward but still require data from dozens of sources. Scope 3 (value chain) emissions are notoriously difficult - they require estimating emissions from suppliers, product use, employee commuting, and end-of-life treatment.

Manual data collection for carbon reporting is labor-intensive, error-prone, and typically conducted annually - too infrequently to inform operational decisions. Many organizations cannot produce Scope 3 estimates with confidence, relying on industry averages rather than actual supply chain data.

## AI Approach

**Automated data collection** - Lambda functions collect energy consumption data from utility APIs, fuel purchase data from procurement systems, transportation data from logistics platforms, and production data from manufacturing systems. Where direct measurement is unavailable, SageMaker models estimate emissions using activity data and emission factors appropriate to the specific context.

**Scope 3 estimation** - For supply chain emissions, SageMaker models combine supplier-specific data (where available) with industry emission factors, economic input-output analysis, and product lifecycle models. Bedrock processes supplier sustainability reports to extract reported emission data and assess its completeness. The model provides emission estimates with uncertainty ranges that reflect data quality.

**Reduction opportunity identification** - The system identifies the highest-impact emission reduction opportunities: energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, renewable energy procurement, supply chain optimization, and process changes. Each opportunity is quantified by emission reduction potential, implementation cost, and payback period.

**Reporting and compliance** - Bedrock generates emissions reports in formats required by regulatory frameworks (CSRD, TCFD, GHG Protocol). The system maintains the data lineage and methodology documentation required for audit. Redshift stores the emissions data warehouse for historical tracking and trend analysis.

## Architecture

Operational data flows from energy management systems, fleet systems, procurement systems, and production systems into Redshift. SageMaker models calculate emissions by source and scope. Bedrock generates reports and processes supplier data. QuickSight dashboards provide real-time emissions monitoring, reduction tracking, and compliance status. The system maintains complete audit trails for external verification.

## Key Considerations

**Data quality transparency** - Not all emissions data is equally reliable. The system should classify data quality levels (measured, calculated, estimated) and report uncertainty ranges. High-quality Scope 1 data should not be mixed with rough Scope 3 estimates without distinguishing their reliability.

**Regulatory evolution** - Emissions reporting standards and regulations are evolving rapidly. The system must adapt to new requirements (additional disclosure categories, changed emission factors, new reporting formats) without structural redesign.

**Reduction vs. reporting** - The strategic value of carbon tracking lies in enabling emission reductions, not just producing reports. Emphasize actionable insights that drive operational decisions alongside compliance reporting.

**Cross-referencing** - Carbon tracking connects to consumption forecasting (energy emissions), fleet management in logistics (transportation emissions), supply chain optimization in manufacturing (supply chain emissions), and renewable optimization (emission reduction through renewables).

## Next Steps

Map the organization's emission sources across all three scopes. Identify data sources for Scope 1 and 2 emissions and automate collection. Build the calculation engine using GHG Protocol methodologies. Produce a baseline emissions inventory. For Scope 3, prioritize the categories with the largest estimated emissions and develop measurement capabilities iteratively.
