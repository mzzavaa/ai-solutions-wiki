Energy consumption forecasting is fundamental to grid operations, energy trading, and utility planning. Generators must match supply to demand in real time; imbalances cause frequency deviations, price spikes, or blackouts. AI forecasting models capture the complex relationships between energy demand and its drivers - weather, economic activity, calendar effects, and consumer behavior - achieving accuracy levels that traditional methods cannot match.

## The Problem

Energy demand is driven by a complex interaction of factors: temperature (heating and cooling), time of day, day of week, holidays, industrial activity, solar exposure (which affects both demand and distributed generation), and behavioral patterns. Traditional forecasting uses regression models with weather inputs, which capture the primary relationships but miss non-linear interactions and rapidly changing patterns.

The growth of distributed energy resources (rooftop solar, battery storage, electric vehicles) has made demand less predictable at the distribution level. A neighborhood's net demand can swing from high consumption to net generation within minutes as cloud cover changes. Grid operators need forecasts at higher temporal and spatial resolution than ever before.

## AI Approach

**Multi-horizon forecasting** - Amazon Forecast generates demand predictions at multiple time horizons: real-time (minutes ahead for grid balancing), short-term (hours ahead for generation scheduling), medium-term (days ahead for energy trading), and long-term (months ahead for capacity planning). Different models serve different horizons, with weather forecasts as a critical input for all.

**Weather-demand modeling** - SageMaker models capture the non-linear relationship between weather and energy demand. The relationship is not simple: demand increases with both extreme cold (heating) and extreme heat (cooling), and the response curve varies by building stock, insulation levels, and HVAC penetration. The model also captures weather-demand interactions with time of day and day of week.

**Building-level forecasting** - For commercial and industrial customers, building-specific models capture occupancy patterns, operational schedules, and equipment cycling. These models enable demand response programs by predicting when each building can reduce consumption with minimal disruption.

**Distributed generation forecasting** - Solar and wind generation forecasts are combined with demand forecasts to produce net demand projections. Kinesis ingests real-time generation data from distributed resources, and SageMaker models forecast near-term generation based on weather and historical patterns.

## Architecture

Smart meter data and SCADA readings stream through Kinesis into S3. Weather forecast data is ingested from meteorological services. Amazon Forecast and SageMaker models produce demand projections across multiple horizons. Forecasts feed into grid operations systems, energy trading platforms, and demand response management systems. Model accuracy is continuously monitored against actual demand.

## Key Considerations

**Forecast accuracy by horizon** - Accuracy degrades with forecast horizon. Real-time forecasts achieve 1-2% MAPE; day-ahead achieves 3-5%; week-ahead achieves 5-8%. Understanding accuracy limits at each horizon is essential for downstream decision quality.

**Extreme events** - Demand during extreme weather events (heat waves, cold snaps) often exceeds historical ranges. The model must extrapolate reasonably beyond training data ranges, and scenario planning should evaluate grid response under extreme conditions.

**Data privacy** - Building-level consumption data is personal data under GDPR. Ensure appropriate legal basis for processing, data minimization, and security.

**Cross-referencing** - Energy consumption forecasting connects to smart metering, outage prediction, renewable optimization, and demand forecasting in retail and logistics (shared time-series forecasting approaches).

## Next Steps

Assess current forecasting accuracy by horizon and identify the highest-value improvement area (typically day-ahead for energy trading or real-time for grid balancing). Build models incorporating weather data and calendar features. Benchmark against the existing forecasting method. Deploy the improved model for the highest-value horizon first.
