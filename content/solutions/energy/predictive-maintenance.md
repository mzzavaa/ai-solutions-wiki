Unplanned downtime in energy infrastructure is expensive and, for grid-connected assets, can affect large numbers of consumers. A single transformer failure can cost 500,000-2,000,000 EUR in replacement and lost production. Predictive maintenance uses AI to move from reactive repair - fix it when it breaks - to condition-based intervention - fix it before it fails, at the lowest-cost moment.

## Sensor Data as the Foundation

Energy infrastructure assets - turbines, transformers, substations, compressors, pipelines - generate continuous streams of sensor data. Temperature, vibration, pressure, current draw, oil sample analysis, and acoustic emissions all carry signals about equipment health. The challenge is extracting meaningful predictive signal from high-volume, often noisy sensor streams.

Anomaly detection models establish a baseline of "normal" behavior for each asset and flag deviations. The approach that works best for energy assets is asset-specific baseline modeling: a turbine at a coastal wind farm operates differently from an identical turbine inland, and a model trained on fleet-wide data will generate too many false positives to be actionable.

## Failure Pattern Models

Beyond anomaly detection, supervised models trained on historical failure data can identify known failure precursors:

- Bearing degradation shows a characteristic vibration frequency shift 2-6 weeks before failure
- Transformer insulation degradation appears in dissolved gas analysis (DGA) readings before visible symptoms
- Pump cavitation produces acoustic signatures detectable 1-3 weeks in advance

Amazon SageMaker is the standard platform for training and deploying these models. For assets with enough historical failure data (typically 50+ failure events per failure mode), supervised classification models outperform anomaly detection. For newer assets or rare failure modes, anomaly detection with domain expert labeling is more practical.

## Maintenance Scheduling Integration

Predicting a failure is only useful if it drives action. Integration with maintenance management systems (CMMS) is where prediction translates to value. The AI output should be a prioritized maintenance queue, not just a list of alerts. Prioritization factors:

- Failure probability and estimated time to failure
- Consequence of failure (revenue impact, safety risk, regulatory implications)
- Current maintenance team capacity and part availability
- Optimal maintenance window (planned outage vs. emergency response cost)

A well-integrated predictive maintenance system reduces emergency maintenance events by 30-50% and extends asset lifetimes by reducing both premature replacement and run-to-failure damage.

## Cost and ROI

Implementation costs for a utility-scale predictive maintenance program typically range from 200,000 to 800,000 EUR depending on asset count, existing sensor infrastructure, and integration complexity. ROI is typically 3-5x over 3 years for organizations with high asset counts and significant historical downtime. The largest gains come from the first 20% of assets - the ones with the highest failure rates and highest downtime costs.

Data readiness is the most common implementation blocker: sensor data quality, historian system access, and historical maintenance records all need to be in order before model training can begin.
