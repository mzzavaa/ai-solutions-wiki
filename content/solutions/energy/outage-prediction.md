Power outages cause significant economic and social disruption. Weather-related outages, equipment failures, and vegetation contact are the primary causes. AI outage prediction enables utilities to anticipate where and when outages are most likely, deploy resources proactively, and communicate with customers before events occur rather than after.

## The Problem

Utilities manage extensive networks of overhead lines, underground cables, transformers, switches, and substations. Equipment ages, weather stresses the network, and vegetation grows into clearance zones. Traditional outage response is reactive: wait for the outage, receive customer reports, locate the fault, dispatch crews, and restore service. This reactive model results in longer outage durations and customer dissatisfaction.

Storm preparation is based on general weather forecasts and historical vulnerability assessments. Crews are pre-positioned in broad geographic areas without granular prediction of where damage will occur. Post-storm, the lack of damage prediction makes restoration prioritization difficult.

## AI Approach

**Weather-outage correlation modeling** - SageMaker models learn the relationship between weather conditions (wind speed, precipitation type and intensity, temperature extremes, lightning) and outage probability at the circuit and feeder level. The model captures local vulnerability factors: overhead line exposure, vegetation proximity, equipment age, and historical outage frequency. Weather forecast data drives outage probability predictions 24-72 hours ahead.

**Equipment failure prediction** - For transformers, switches, and cable segments, predictive models estimate failure probability based on age, load history, maintenance records, and operational conditions (temperature, loading cycles). Kinesis ingests real-time SCADA data for continuous condition monitoring. This connects to predictive maintenance in manufacturing - the same fundamental approach applied to grid equipment.

**Vegetation risk assessment** - Satellite and aerial imagery analyzed by computer vision models assess vegetation encroachment on power line corridors. The analysis identifies locations where trees are growing into clearance zones and prioritizes vegetation management work based on outage risk rather than fixed trim cycles.

**Restoration optimization** - When outages occur, the system predicts damage severity and estimated repair time for each affected area, enabling optimal crew dispatch. Customer communication systems use these predictions to provide outage notifications with realistic restoration estimates.

## Architecture

Weather forecast data, SCADA readings, and smart meter data (which detect outages at the customer level) flow into the prediction pipeline through Kinesis. SageMaker models generate outage probability maps by circuit for the forecast horizon. Amazon Forecast provides time-series predictions for resource demand planning. Predictions feed into the outage management system (OMS) and customer communication platforms. Post-event, actual outage data feeds back into model retraining.

## Key Considerations

**Prediction granularity** - Grid-level outage predictions are most useful at the circuit or feeder level, where they can inform specific crew positioning and switching decisions. Predictions at too broad a geographic level are not actionable.

**Extreme event performance** - The model must perform well during extreme weather events, which are precisely when predictions matter most and when conditions may exceed historical training data ranges. Stress-testing the model against historical extreme events validates performance under the conditions that matter.

**Customer communication** - Proactive outage communication (before the outage occurs) dramatically improves customer satisfaction compared to reactive notification. The system should communicate predicted impacts and preparation advice to affected customers.

**Cross-referencing** - Outage prediction connects to consumption forecasting, infrastructure monitoring in government, predictive maintenance in manufacturing, and renewable optimization (generation availability during events).

## Next Steps

Analyze historical outage data to identify the primary outage causes and correlating factors. Build weather-outage models for the circuits with the highest outage frequency. Validate against historical storms by retrospectively predicting outage locations and comparing against actual damage. Deploy predictions for storm preparation planning and measure the improvement in crew positioning and restoration times.
