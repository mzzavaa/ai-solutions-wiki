Power grids were designed for a world of predictable, dispatchable generation and relatively stable demand. The rapid growth of variable renewable generation (wind, solar) and demand-side flexibility (EVs, heat pumps, industrial loads) has made grid management significantly more complex. AI is increasingly embedded in the control systems and planning tools that keep grids in balance.

## Demand Forecasting

Accurate demand forecasting is the foundation of grid operation. Forecast errors directly translate to either over-procurement (wasted cost) or under-procurement (frequency deviation and potential blackouts). AI-based demand forecasting outperforms traditional statistical models by 15-30% in mean absolute error, primarily because it can incorporate a broader set of input variables: weather forecasts, calendar effects, economic indicators, and behavioral patterns.

Forecast horizons matter: day-ahead forecasts inform market participation and unit commitment; intra-day forecasts (15-minute to 4-hour horizons) inform real-time dispatch; week-ahead forecasts support maintenance scheduling. Different model architectures perform best at different horizons - LSTM and Transformer-based models work well for intra-day; gradient boosting methods often outperform deep learning for longer horizons where explanatory variables dominate.

## Renewable Integration

Variable generation creates imbalances that must be compensated by flexible assets (storage, hydro, gas peakers) or demand response. AI helps on two fronts:

**Generation forecasting** - Solar and wind output forecasts based on weather models, plant-specific production curves, and historical bias correction. Short-term (0-6 hour) forecasts are most valuable for real-time grid balancing.

**Curtailment minimization** - When generation exceeds transmission capacity, curtailment (forcing generators offline) wastes renewable energy and revenue. AI scheduling models optimize which assets to curtail and when, minimizing total curtailment subject to grid constraints.

## Smart Grid Management

Distribution grid optimization is distinct from transmission-level balancing. At the distribution level, AI applications include:

- **Fault detection and isolation** - Automated identification of fault locations using smart meter and SCADA data, enabling faster restoration
- **Voltage optimization** - Adjusting reactive power resources to maintain voltage within limits across the distribution network
- **EV charging coordination** - Smoothing the demand impact of EV charging by shifting flexible load to off-peak periods, either through pricing signals or direct control

## Regulatory and Market Context

Grid optimization AI operates within tight regulatory constraints. Changes to dispatch logic or forecasting methodology may require regulatory approval in some jurisdictions. The EU Network Codes (particularly the Electricity Balancing Guideline) define the framework within which flexibility assets can operate. AI systems used in regulated grid operations need explainability - operators must be able to understand and override AI recommendations.

The practical path for most grid operators is AI as decision support rather than autonomous control - the AI generates optimized schedules and recommendations, and human operators retain final authority.
