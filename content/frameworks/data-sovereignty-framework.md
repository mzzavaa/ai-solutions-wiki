Data sovereignty for AI systems in the EU requires a systematic approach that addresses legal requirements, technical architecture, and operational governance. This framework provides a structured method for organizations to establish and maintain data sovereignty across their AI operations.

## Legal Foundation

Understand the applicable legal requirements. **GDPR Chapter V** governs international data transfers with specific transfer mechanisms (adequacy decisions, SCCs, BCRs). **National data sovereignty laws** may impose additional requirements, particularly for government data, health data, and financial data. **Sector-specific regulations** (DORA for financial services, NIS2 for critical infrastructure) may restrict where data can be processed. **Contractual obligations** from customers or partners may impose data residency requirements beyond legal minimums.

Create a legal requirements matrix that maps each data category to its applicable jurisdictional restrictions, permitted transfer mechanisms, and any sector-specific constraints.

## Data Classification

Classify all data used in AI systems by sovereignty sensitivity. **Sovereignty-critical** - Data that must remain within a specific jurisdiction under law or contract: personal data without adequate transfer mechanisms, classified government data, health records with national residency requirements. **Sovereignty-sensitive** - Data that can be transferred with appropriate safeguards: personal data covered by SCCs, financial data with contractual residency preferences. **Sovereignty-neutral** - Data with no jurisdictional restrictions: anonymized data, publicly available data, synthetic data, non-personal operational data.

Apply this classification at the data element level, not just the dataset level. A dataset containing both personal and non-personal data is classified based on its most restrictive element.

## Architectural Principles

**Data gravity** - Process data as close to its storage location as possible. Move computation to data rather than data to computation. **Regional isolation** - Implement hard boundaries between regional environments using separate accounts, encryption keys, and network segments. **Metadata separation** - Keep metadata and control plane information separate from data. Metadata about data locations and classifications can often cross boundaries even when the data itself cannot. **Encryption sovereignty** - Control encryption keys within the data's jurisdiction. Use regional KMS instances with keys that cannot be accessed from other regions.

## Operational Governance

**Data flow mapping** - Maintain an up-to-date map of all data flows in AI systems, including training data movement, model artifact distribution, inference data paths, and logging/monitoring data flows. Update the map whenever architecture changes. **Transfer authorization** - Implement a formal process for authorizing cross-border data transfers. Each transfer must have a documented legal basis, a transfer impact assessment (where required), and approval from the data protection team. **Monitoring and enforcement** - Deploy technical controls that prevent unauthorized data movement: network policies that restrict data egress from regional environments, DLP rules that detect personal data in cross-border traffic, and automated alerts when data is accessed from unexpected regions.

## AI-Specific Considerations

**Training data** - Ensure training data stays in its required jurisdiction. Use federated learning or synthetic data techniques when cross-jurisdiction training is needed. **Model artifacts** - Assess whether model weights contain personal data (through memorization). If so, treat model weights with the same sovereignty requirements as the training data. **Inference** - Deploy inference endpoints in each jurisdiction where users are located. Route requests based on the user's jurisdiction. **Monitoring data** - Inference logs may contain personal data. Store them within the same jurisdiction as the inference endpoint.

## Maturity Levels

**Level 1 (Awareness)** - Data flows are documented. Sovereignty requirements are understood. **Level 2 (Controls)** - Technical controls enforce regional boundaries. Transfer processes are formalized. **Level 3 (Automation)** - Policy-as-code enforces sovereignty rules. Automated monitoring detects violations. **Level 4 (Optimization)** - Sovereignty controls are embedded in CI/CD. Architecture is optimized for multi-region efficiency while maintaining strict sovereignty.

Assess your current maturity and define a roadmap to your target level based on regulatory requirements and organizational risk appetite.
