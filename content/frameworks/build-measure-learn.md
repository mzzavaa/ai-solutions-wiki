Build-Measure-Learn (BML) is the core feedback loop from the Lean Startup methodology, and it maps naturally to AI development. Every AI project is fundamentally an experiment: you hypothesize that a model can solve a problem, build a version, measure its performance, and learn whether to continue, adjust, or pivot. The framework's value is in making this cycle explicit, fast, and disciplined rather than allowing open-ended experimentation that consumes time without producing decisions.

## The Loop Applied to AI

### Build

The "Build" step creates the minimum artifact needed to test the current hypothesis. This is not a production system. It is the cheapest, fastest thing that generates measurable evidence.

**Data experiment** - If the hypothesis is "sufficient labeled data exists," the build step is a data profiling exercise: sample the data, assess quality, check label distributions. No model needed.

**Model experiment** - If the hypothesis is "a model can achieve X% accuracy," the build step is a baseline model: the simplest approach (logistic regression, basic prompting) trained on available data. If the baseline is far from the target, a more complex approach is unlikely to close the gap.

**Integration experiment** - If the hypothesis is "users will adopt AI suggestions," the build step is a prototype integrated into the user's workflow, potentially with simulated model outputs.

**Business experiment** - If the hypothesis is "AI automation saves enough time to justify cost," the build step is a time-motion study comparing current manual process to AI-assisted process.

### Measure

The "Measure" step collects quantitative data against pre-defined success criteria. Define what you will measure before you build. This prevents post-hoc rationalization where teams interpret ambiguous results as positive.

**AI-specific measurements**:
- Model accuracy on a held-out test set (not the training set)
- Latency at the expected request volume
- User task completion time with and without AI assistance
- User trust and confidence scores (survey or behavioral proxy)
- Cost per prediction at production volume

**Measurement traps to avoid**:
- Measuring only accuracy without measuring whether accuracy at that level creates business value
- Measuring engagement (users clicked on AI suggestions) without measuring outcomes (AI suggestions improved decisions)
- Comparing AI performance to perfection rather than to the current baseline (humans making the same decisions)

### Learn

The "Learn" step makes a decision based on the measurements. Three outcomes:

**Persevere** - The hypothesis is confirmed. Proceed to the next cycle with increased investment. "Baseline accuracy is 85%, target is 90%, and we have identified specific improvements (better features, more data) that can close the gap."

**Pivot** - The measurements show the current approach will not work, but the problem is still worth solving. Change the approach. "Text classification cannot distinguish these categories, but a RAG-based approach that retrieves relevant examples achieves the user's goal."

**Stop** - The measurements show the problem is not tractable, the data is insufficient, or the business value is lower than expected. Stopping is a valid outcome that saves resources for higher-value projects.

## Cycle Duration

Each BML cycle should last 1-2 weeks for data and model experiments, 2-4 weeks for integration experiments, and 4-8 weeks for business experiments. If a cycle takes longer, the hypothesis is too broad. Break it into smaller, testable components.

## Structuring the Experiment

Document each cycle with a lightweight experiment card:

- **Hypothesis**: What we believe is true.
- **Test**: What we will build to test it.
- **Metric**: What we will measure and the threshold for success/failure.
- **Duration**: How long we will run the test.
- **Decision**: What we will do based on each possible outcome.

This card prevents scope creep within the cycle and ensures the team knows what decision the experiment informs.

## Common Anti-Patterns

**Building without hypotheses** - Exploring data and building models without a specific question to answer. This produces interesting findings but not decisions.

**Measuring without thresholds** - Collecting metrics without defining what "good enough" looks like. Any accuracy number can be rationalized as promising.

**Learning without deciding** - Running experiments and producing reports but never making the persevere/pivot/stop decision. The team continues on momentum rather than evidence.

**Cycles too long** - Three-month cycles produce detailed results but consume resources that could fund several fast cycles. Speed of learning matters more than depth of any single experiment.

## When to Use BML

Use BML throughout AI project development: for initial feasibility assessment (can we solve this?), during model development (which approach works best?), during integration (will users adopt this?), and post-deployment (is the system delivering value?). The loop never stops; production AI systems need ongoing BML cycles to stay relevant.
