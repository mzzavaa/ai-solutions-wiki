Release management determines how software moves from development to production. For AI systems, this includes both application code and trained models, which have different lifecycles, different validation requirements, and different rollback characteristics. This framework covers release cadences, release trains, and semantic versioning automation.

## Release Cadences

The right release cadence depends on the system's risk profile, testing requirements, and organizational maturity.

**Continuous deployment** pushes every merged change to production automatically. This works for application code backed by comprehensive automated tests but is risky for model releases where performance can only be fully validated in production. Teams using continuous deployment for models typically gate releases behind shadow deployments or canary releases.

**Scheduled releases** ship on a fixed cadence (weekly, biweekly, monthly). This provides predictable release windows for stakeholders and allows batching of changes for more thorough validation. AI teams often use biweekly releases for application code and monthly releases for model updates, since model validation takes longer.

**Release trains** are fixed-schedule releases that ship whatever is ready. If a feature misses the train, it waits for the next one. This decouples feature development from release timing and reduces the pressure to rush incomplete work into a release. Release trains work well for AI platform teams that support multiple model teams.

**Event-driven releases** are triggered by specific events: a data drift alert, a significant accuracy drop, a regulatory requirement change. These are common for model retraining but require mature monitoring and automated validation pipelines to execute safely.

## Release Train Model

A release train operates on a fixed schedule with defined phases:

**Development window** (e.g., 3 weeks) - Feature branches are developed and merged. Model experiments are run. During this phase, the train is "open" for new features.

**Stabilization window** (e.g., 1 week) - The release branch is cut. Only bug fixes and critical model performance improvements are merged. This phase focuses on integration testing, performance testing, and release validation.

**Release day** - The validated release is deployed to production. If the release does not pass validation, it is delayed or features are removed until it does.

**Retrospective** - The team reviews what shipped, what was deferred, and what process improvements are needed.

For AI systems, the stabilization window must include model validation against production-representative data, bias audits, and resource utilization testing. These steps are often the bottleneck, so plan the stabilization window accordingly.

## Semantic Versioning for AI Systems

Semantic versioning (SemVer) uses MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH to communicate the nature of changes. For AI systems, the mapping is:

**MAJOR** - Breaking changes to the API contract, input/output schema changes, or model changes that significantly alter behavior (e.g., a new model architecture that changes prediction distributions substantially).

**MINOR** - New features, new model capabilities, or model performance improvements that are backward-compatible. A retrained model that improves accuracy but maintains the same API and similar prediction distributions is a MINOR change.

**PATCH** - Bug fixes, configuration changes, infrastructure updates, and minor model retraining on refreshed data with no significant performance change.

### Versioning Automation

Automate version bumping using commit message conventions. Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING CHANGE:`) paired with tools like semantic-release or commitizen can automatically determine the next version number, generate changelogs, and create release tags.

For model versioning, extend the system with model-specific metadata: training data version, hyperparameter hash, and performance metrics. Store this metadata in the model registry (MLflow, Weights & Biases, SageMaker Model Registry) alongside the version tag.

A typical automated release pipeline:

1. Developer merges a PR with conventional commit messages
2. CI pipeline runs tests and model validation
3. semantic-release determines the version bump from commit messages
4. The pipeline builds artifacts, tags the release, and publishes to the artifact registry
5. For model releases, the pipeline registers the model version with performance metrics in the model registry
6. The deployment pipeline promotes the new version through staging to production

## Coordinating Code and Model Releases

The most challenging aspect of AI release management is coordinating application code releases with model releases. A new model version may require updated preprocessing code, new feature definitions, or API schema changes.

**Version compatibility matrices** document which model versions are compatible with which application versions. This prevents deploying a model that expects features the serving code does not provide.

**Feature flags** allow shipping new model versions behind toggles, enabling gradual rollout and instant rollback without redeployment.

**Independent release pipelines** with contract testing allow model and application teams to release independently as long as both sides of the contract (input schema, output schema, performance SLAs) are maintained.
