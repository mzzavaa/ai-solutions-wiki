Data fabric is an architectural approach that uses metadata, knowledge graphs, and machine learning to create a unified, intelligent layer over an organization's diverse data sources. Rather than moving all data into a single centralized repository, data fabric connects data where it lives and uses active metadata to automate data discovery, governance, integration, and delivery. Gartner has identified data fabric as a top data and analytics trend, and the approach is increasingly adopted by enterprises that need to make their data AI-ready without undertaking massive data consolidation projects.

## The Problem Data Fabric Solves

Large enterprises typically have data distributed across hundreds of systems: relational databases, data warehouses, data lakes, SaaS applications, mainframes, file shares, and streaming platforms. Each system has its own schema, security model, and access patterns. Making this data available for AI workloads requires solving several problems simultaneously: knowing what data exists, understanding what it means, ensuring it meets quality standards, enforcing access controls, and delivering it in the format and latency that consumers need.

Traditional approaches to this problem -- building point-to-point integrations or consolidating everything into a central warehouse -- do not scale. Point-to-point integrations create brittle, unmaintainable architectures. Centralization projects take years, cost millions, and are never truly complete because new data sources appear continuously.

## Core Components

### Active Metadata Layer

The foundation of a data fabric is an active metadata layer that continuously collects, integrates, and analyzes metadata from across the enterprise. This includes technical metadata (schemas, data types, volumes), operational metadata (query patterns, access frequencies, pipeline status), business metadata (definitions, ownership, classification), and social metadata (who uses what data, who is the expert for each domain).

The metadata layer is "active" because it does not just store metadata passively. It uses machine learning to identify patterns, detect anomalies, recommend integrations, and automate governance tasks. For example, it can automatically classify sensitive data, suggest joins between related datasets, or flag data quality degradation.

### Knowledge Graph

A knowledge graph provides the semantic layer that connects metadata from different sources into a unified, queryable model. Entities such as "customer," "product," or "transaction" are represented once in the knowledge graph even if they appear in dozens of source systems under different names and schemas. The knowledge graph enables data consumers to search for data by business concepts rather than by table names or system locations.

### Automated Data Integration

Data fabric uses metadata-driven automation to generate and maintain data integration pipelines. Rather than manually coding ETL jobs for each data movement, the fabric infers integration logic from metadata patterns and generates pipelines automatically. This dramatically reduces the time required to make new data sources available and keeps integration logic consistent with governance policies.

### Unified Governance

Access control, privacy policies, data quality rules, and compliance requirements are defined once in the fabric and enforced consistently regardless of where the data physically resides. This is particularly important for AI workloads that combine data from multiple sources, as each source may have different security and privacy requirements that must be respected throughout the pipeline.

## Data Fabric for AI Workloads

Data fabric is particularly valuable for AI because AI projects are data-hungry and data-diverse. A single AI model might need customer data from a CRM, transaction data from an ERP, behavioral data from a web analytics platform, and market data from external APIs. Without a data fabric, the data engineer must manually discover, access, integrate, and govern each of these sources. With a data fabric, the discovery and integration are substantially automated.

The metadata layer also supports AI-specific concerns such as data lineage for model explainability, automated bias detection across training datasets, and feature discovery through metadata analysis.

## Data Fabric vs. Data Mesh

Data fabric and data mesh are complementary rather than competing approaches. Data mesh is an organizational pattern that decentralizes data ownership to domain teams. Data fabric is a technology architecture that automates data management. An organization can implement a data mesh organizational model while using data fabric technology to provide the self-serve data infrastructure that domain teams need. The fabric provides the automation; the mesh provides the ownership model.
