Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean manufacturing technique that visualizes the entire flow of materials and information from request to delivery. Each step is documented with its processing time, wait time, and quality rate. The map reveals where value is created and where waste accumulates. For AI projects, VSM serves two purposes: mapping the AI delivery process itself (how models move from concept to production) and mapping business processes to identify where AI intervention would eliminate the most waste.

## Mapping Business Processes for AI Opportunities

A value stream map of a business process reveals the steps where AI can have the greatest impact. Create the map by walking through the process end-to-end with the people who perform it.

For each step, record:

**Processing time** - How long does the actual work take? A human reviewing a document might spend 15 minutes per document.

**Wait time** - How long does work sit between steps? A document might wait 2 days in a queue before being reviewed.

**Quality rate** - What percentage of outputs from this step are correct? If 10% of reviews contain errors, this is a quality problem AI might address.

**Rework loops** - Where does work get sent back for correction? Rework indicates inconsistency that AI could reduce.

The total lead time (processing time plus wait time across all steps) compared to the total processing time reveals the process efficiency ratio. Most business processes have efficiency ratios below 10%: 90% of the time, work is waiting rather than being worked on.

## Identifying AI Intervention Points

AI has the highest impact at steps with:

**High wait times** - If documents wait 2 days for human review, AI can process them immediately, eliminating the queue. This often delivers more value than making the review faster.

**High rework rates** - If 15% of outputs need correction, AI can either pre-screen for quality or assist the human to get it right the first time.

**High processing time on routine work** - If an expert spends 30 minutes on a task that is routine 80% of the time, AI can handle the routine cases and escalate only the complex 20%.

**Decision bottlenecks** - If work stalls because a single expert must approve every item, AI can triage or auto-approve items that meet defined criteria.

## Mapping the AI Delivery Value Stream

VSM applied to the AI development process itself reveals delivery bottlenecks:

**Data access** - How long does it take from requesting data to having it available for model development? In many organizations, this is weeks or months due to governance approvals, security reviews, and data engineering work.

**Model development** - How long from data availability to a trained, evaluated model? This is typically the most visible phase but often not the longest.

**Deployment** - How long from a trained model to production deployment? Infrastructure provisioning, security reviews, integration testing, and approval processes can add weeks.

**Feedback** - How long from deployment to actionable performance data? If monitoring is inadequate, drift can go undetected for months.

Map the entire AI delivery stream and calculate efficiency. If the total lead time from idea to production is 6 months but total processing time is 3 weeks, the efficiency ratio is under 10%. The remaining time is wait states that can be targeted for improvement.

## Common Waste Types in AI Projects

**Waiting** - Data access delays, model review queues, infrastructure provisioning, approval processes. The most common waste in AI delivery.

**Overprocessing** - Building more complex models than the problem requires. Achieving 99% accuracy when 90% delivers the same business value.

**Defects** - Models that fail in production due to data quality issues not caught during development. Training on unrepresentative data.

**Handoffs** - Data scientists handing off models to ML engineers who hand off to DevOps. Each handoff introduces delay and information loss.

**Inventory** - Trained models sitting on the shelf because deployment infrastructure is not ready. POCs completed but never productionized.

## Creating the Future State Map

After mapping the current state and identifying waste, design a future state that eliminates or reduces the highest-impact waste. Common future state improvements for AI delivery:

- Self-service data access through a data catalog and governed data platform (reduces data access wait time from weeks to hours).
- Automated ML pipelines that handle training, evaluation, and deployment (reduces handoff waste and deployment time).
- Standardized model serving infrastructure that eliminates custom deployment work for each model.
- Continuous monitoring that provides performance feedback within hours, not months.

## When to Use VSM for AI

Use VSM when AI projects are taking too long to reach production (map the delivery stream to find bottlenecks), when selecting business processes for AI intervention (map the business process to quantify waste), or when justifying AI investment (the waste quantification provides the ROI case).
