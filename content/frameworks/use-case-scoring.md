When organizations run their first AI ideation workshop, they rarely leave with too few ideas. They leave with too many - Post-it notes covering three whiteboards, a shared document with 57 bullet points, and no clear path forward. The Use Case Scoring Framework exists to solve exactly that problem.

## Why Generic Prioritization Fails for AI

Standard backlog prioritization tools like MoSCoW or simple effort/impact matrices miss dimensions that matter specifically for AI projects. They do not account for data sensitivity risks, which can turn a promising automation into a compliance problem. They do not weight customer reach in a way that distinguishes between a tool used by 3 internal analysts and one that touches every customer invoice. This framework adds those dimensions explicitly.

## The Scoring Dimensions

Each use case is scored across five dimensions. The maximum weighted score is 100 points.

**Time Savings (0-40 points)** - This is the highest-weighted dimension because time savings translate directly into FTE cost reduction or capacity reallocation. Score based on hours saved per week across all users: under 5 hours scores 0-10, 5-20 hours scores 10-25, over 20 hours scores 25-40.

**Customer Reach (0-35 points)** - How many end customers or users does the automation touch? Internal tools affecting fewer than 10 people score low. Customer-facing workflows touching thousands score at the top of this range. Reach amplifies impact in ways that pure efficiency metrics miss.

**Data Sensitivity (0-25 points, inverted)** - This dimension is a risk gate. A use case processing public web data scores 20-25. One touching regulated financial data or health records scores 0-5. This is intentionally harsh: high-sensitivity use cases require compliance reviews, security architecture, and longer delivery timelines that often kill ROI.

**Effort (1-10, separate axis)** - Scored independently. Not blended into the 100-point total. This creates a classic effort/value quadrant when plotted.

**Business Impact (1-10, separate axis)** - Strategic alignment score. Does this use case support a stated company objective? Rated by the business sponsor, not the technical team.

## Running the Scoring Workshop

The workshop works best with 6-8 participants: one business sponsor per use case cluster, two technical leads, and a facilitator who does not score.

1. Present each use case in 90 seconds - problem, proposed solution, rough data requirements.
2. Each participant scores independently on paper or a shared spreadsheet.
3. Facilitator reveals scores and discusses outliers (scores differing by more than 3 points).
4. Recalibrate where there was genuine information asymmetry, not just disagreement.
5. Plot final scores on the effort/value matrix.

The top-right quadrant (high value, low effort) becomes your prototype shortlist - typically 3-5 candidates from an original pool of 40-60 ideas.

## When to Use This Framework

This framework is most effective after a discovery workshop where use cases have already been loosely defined. It is not a replacement for discovery - it is the filter that follows it. Use it when you have more viable ideas than capacity to prototype, and when you need a defensible, documented rationale for what you chose to build first.

For organizations running their first AI program, the scoring session itself is valuable beyond the output: it forces business and technical stakeholders to agree on what good looks like before any code is written.
