Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for AI projects quantifies the financial investment required and the value returned, producing ROI projections that inform go/no-go decisions. AI projects have cost structures that differ from traditional software: model training compute costs, ongoing inference costs, data labeling expenses, and the probabilistic nature of outcomes. A rigorous CBA accounts for these differences and presents a realistic case to decision-makers.

## Cost Categories

### Development Costs (One-Time)

**Data preparation** - Acquiring, cleaning, labeling, and transforming training data. This is frequently underestimated. Include: data engineer time, data labeling services (or internal labeling team time), data acquisition costs if external data is needed, and legal review for data usage rights. For many projects, data preparation is 40-60% of total development cost.

**Model development** - Data scientist and ML engineer time for experimentation, training, evaluation, and optimization. Include: compute costs for training (GPU hours), experiment tracking infrastructure, and evaluation dataset creation.

**Integration** - Software engineering to embed the model into existing systems. Include: API development, UI changes, workflow modifications, and testing.

**Infrastructure setup** - Provisioning the serving infrastructure, monitoring systems, CI/CD pipelines, and data pipelines. Include: cloud infrastructure costs during development and DevOps engineering time.

### Ongoing Costs (Recurring)

**Inference compute** - The cost of running predictions in production. This scales with usage and can be significant for high-volume applications. Calculate: average requests per day x cost per request x 30 days.

**Model maintenance** - Monitoring, retraining, and updating models as data distributions shift. Allocate 20-30% of the development team's ongoing capacity for maintenance of production models.

**Data pipeline operation** - Keeping data pipelines running, monitoring data quality, and handling data source changes. Often requires a dedicated data engineer.

**Cloud infrastructure** - Storage, networking, monitoring services, and any always-on infrastructure. These costs persist as long as the system is in production.

**Support and operations** - Handling escalations, investigating model failures, and supporting users. Budget 0.5-1 FTE for each major AI system in production.

## Benefit Categories

### Direct Benefits (Quantifiable)

**Labor savings** - Time saved by automating or accelerating tasks. Calculate: hours saved per task x tasks per month x loaded hourly rate. Be realistic: full task automation rarely achieves 100% immediately. Use conservative estimates (60-80% automation rate for the first year).

**Error reduction** - Costs avoided by reducing mistakes. Calculate: current error rate x cost per error (rework time, customer impact, compliance penalties) x expected error rate reduction.

**Revenue increase** - Additional revenue from AI-enabled capabilities (better recommendations, faster response to opportunities, new product features). These are harder to attribute directly to AI and should be estimated conservatively.

### Indirect Benefits (Harder to Quantify)

**Scalability** - Ability to handle volume growth without proportional headcount increase. Quantify by estimating the hiring that would be needed without AI.

**Consistency** - Standardized quality across all outputs, regardless of individual skill levels. Harder to quantify but important for compliance-driven organizations.

**Speed** - Faster turnaround enabling better customer experience or competitive advantage. Quantify by estimating the business value of reduced cycle time.

## Building the ROI Model

Create a 3-year model (typical for AI projects) with the following structure:

**Year 0 (Development)** - All development costs, no benefits. The model runs at a loss during development.

**Year 1 (Deployment and Ramp)** - Ongoing costs begin. Benefits ramp from 0% at launch to the steady-state estimate by year-end. Use a ramp curve (25% Q1, 50% Q2, 75% Q3, 100% Q4) to model gradual adoption.

**Year 2-3 (Steady State)** - Full ongoing costs, full benefits. Model maintenance costs may increase slightly as model drift requires retraining.

**ROI Calculation** - ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs x 100. Also calculate: payback period (when cumulative benefits exceed cumulative costs), net present value (NPV using the organization's discount rate), and internal rate of return (IRR).

## Sensitivity Analysis

AI projects have high uncertainty. Run the model at three scenarios:

**Conservative** - Lower bound on benefits (60% of base case), upper bound on costs (120% of base case). This is the worst realistic case.

**Base case** - Your best estimate based on available evidence.

**Optimistic** - Upper bound on benefits (130% of base case), lower bound on costs (90% of base case).

If the conservative scenario still shows positive ROI, the project is low risk. If only the optimistic scenario shows positive ROI, the project needs a funded POC to gather evidence before full commitment.

## Presenting to Stakeholders

Lead with the business problem and its current cost, not the technology. "We spend $2.4M annually on manual document processing" is a stronger opening than "We want to build an NLP model." Present the three scenarios, emphasize the payback period, and include the key assumptions that most affect the outcome.

## When to Use CBA

Use formal CBA for AI projects requesting significant investment (>$100K or >3 months of team time). For smaller experiments and POCs, lightweight justification (problem statement, estimated value, time and cost to test) is sufficient.
