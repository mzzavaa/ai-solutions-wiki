A KPI (Key Performance Indicator) framework for AI defines what to measure, how to measure it, and what the measurements mean for decision-making. Unlike OKRs, which set aspirational targets, KPIs provide ongoing operational visibility. For AI projects, a well-designed KPI framework answers three questions: Is the AI working technically? Is it delivering business value? Is it operationally healthy?

## The Three Layers of AI KPIs

### Layer 1: Technical Performance KPIs

These measure how well the AI system performs its core task.

**Accuracy metrics** - Precision, recall, F1 score, AUC-ROC for classification. RMSE, MAE for regression. BLEU, ROUGE for generation quality. Select the metric that aligns with the business cost of errors. When false negatives are expensive (fraud detection, medical screening), prioritize recall. When false positives are expensive (spam filtering customer emails), prioritize precision.

**Latency metrics** - P50, P95, P99 response times. Latency SLAs should be defined by the user experience requirement: interactive applications need <500ms, real-time decisions need <100ms, batch processing can tolerate minutes.

**Throughput metrics** - Requests per second, documents processed per hour, predictions generated per day. Track against capacity limits to anticipate scaling needs.

**Data quality metrics** - Input data completeness, freshness, and schema conformance. A model trained on complete data will fail on incomplete production inputs. Track the gap between training data quality and production data quality.

### Layer 2: Business Impact KPIs

These measure the value the AI delivers to the organization.

**Efficiency KPIs** - Time saved per task, tasks automated per day, FTE equivalent capacity freed. These are the most common AI ROI metrics because they are directly measurable.

**Quality KPIs** - Error rate reduction, consistency improvement, compliance rate increase. Compare pre-AI and post-AI quality metrics on the same process.

**Revenue KPIs** - Conversion rate improvement, recommendation click-through rate, upsell success rate. These are harder to attribute directly to AI but are the most compelling for executive audiences.

**Cost KPIs** - Cost per prediction, cost per automated task, total AI infrastructure cost as a percentage of value delivered. Track the fully loaded cost including compute, data storage, monitoring, and team time.

### Layer 3: Operational Health KPIs

These measure whether the AI system is running reliably.

**Availability** - Uptime percentage. Target 99.9% for business-critical AI systems.

**Drift indicators** - Feature distribution shift, prediction distribution shift, accuracy trend over time. Drift KPIs provide early warning before performance degradation affects users.

**Error rates** - API errors, timeout rates, malformed input rates. These indicate integration issues and data pipeline problems.

**Resource utilization** - GPU utilization, memory usage, storage growth rate. These drive capacity planning and cost optimization.

## Building a KPI Dashboard

A single AI KPI dashboard should provide at-a-glance health across all three layers. Structure it as:

**Header** - Current model version, last training date, data freshness timestamp. This context is essential for interpreting metrics.

**Technical section** - Accuracy trend (line chart over time), latency percentiles (gauge or bar), throughput (time series).

**Business section** - Primary business metric (the one metric that matters most), compared to pre-AI baseline and target.

**Operational section** - Availability status, active alerts, drift score, resource utilization.

Use Amazon Managed Grafana or QuickSight to build dashboards that auto-refresh and support drill-down.

## Setting KPI Targets

Set targets based on three reference points: the pre-AI baseline (what performance was before AI), the business requirement (what performance must be for the AI to deliver value), and the technical ceiling (what performance is theoretically achievable given data quality and model capability). The target should be between the business requirement and the technical ceiling.

## Reporting Cadence

**Daily** - Operational health KPIs (automated dashboard, alerts for anomalies).

**Weekly** - Technical performance KPIs (reviewed by the AI team, action on trends).

**Monthly** - Business impact KPIs (reviewed with business stakeholders, tie AI metrics to business outcomes).

**Quarterly** - Comprehensive review connecting all three layers, informing investment decisions for the next quarter.

## When to Use This Framework

Apply KPI frameworks to every AI system in production. The investment in measurement pays for itself through early detection of drift, informed capacity planning, and credible ROI reporting that justifies continued AI investment.
