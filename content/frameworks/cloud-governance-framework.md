Enterprise cloud governance for AI workloads requires a structured framework that balances enablement (letting AI teams move fast) with control (maintaining security, compliance, and cost discipline). This framework defines the organizational model, policy layers, and operational practices needed.

## Organizational Structure

**Cloud Center of Excellence (CCoE)** - A cross-functional team responsible for defining governance policies, maintaining the cloud platform, and providing guidance to AI teams. The CCoE includes representatives from security, compliance, architecture, and finance. It does not own the AI workloads but owns the guardrails within which AI teams operate.

**Platform Engineering Team** - Builds and maintains the shared cloud infrastructure: landing zones, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, and self-service provisioning tools. For AI workloads, this includes model registries, ML pipeline infrastructure, and GPU compute pools.

**AI Product Teams** - Own their AI systems end to end. They operate within the governance boundaries set by the CCoE and use the infrastructure provided by the platform team. They are responsible for their system's compliance but rely on centralized governance controls for baseline security.

## Policy Framework

Organize policies into three tiers. **Mandatory policies** (enforced automatically, no exceptions): encryption at rest, private network access for data stores, multi-factor authentication, resource tagging, region restrictions for data sovereignty. **Standard policies** (default on, exception possible with approval): specific instance types for cost control, approved AI services list, data classification requirements, retention policies. **Advisory policies** (recommended, tracked for adoption): architecture patterns, naming conventions, documentation standards.

Implement policies as code using cloud-native tools (SCPs, Azure Policy, GCP Organization Policies) and cross-cloud tools (OPA, Sentinel, Checkov). Policies should be version-controlled, tested, and deployed through the same CI/CD process as application code.

## Security Governance

**Identity and access** - Implement centralized identity management (SSO) with role-based access control. Define ML-specific roles (data scientist, ML engineer, model reviewer, model deployer) with least-privilege permissions. Separate permissions between development and production environments.

**Network security** - Isolate AI workloads in private subnets. Use VPC endpoints for cloud AI services. Implement network segmentation between training, inference, and data storage environments. Monitor network traffic for anomalies.

**Data security** - Classify data at ingestion. Encrypt all data at rest and in transit. Implement data loss prevention controls for AI interactions with external services. Monitor for sensitive data exposure in model inputs and outputs.

## Cost Governance

**Allocation** - Tag all resources with cost center, project, and environment. Use cloud billing tools to allocate costs to AI teams and projects. Implement showback or chargeback to create cost awareness.

**Budgeting** - Set budgets at the team and project level. Configure alerts at progressive thresholds. Implement hard caps for non-production environments (automatically stop instances when budget is exhausted).

**Optimization** - Review GPU utilization weekly. Implement spot instances for training where fault tolerance allows. Right-size inference endpoints based on actual traffic. Implement semantic caching for LLM APIs. Set maximum runtime limits on training jobs.

## Compliance Integration

Map governance controls to regulatory requirements (GDPR, NIS2, DORA, EU AI Act). For each regulation, identify which governance controls provide evidence of compliance. Generate automated compliance reports from the governance platform. Maintain an exception register that documents any approved deviations from standard policies, including the risk assessment and compensating controls.

## Continuous Improvement

Measure governance effectiveness through metrics: time to provision compliant AI infrastructure, number of policy violations detected, mean time to remediate findings, cloud spend variance against budget, and security incident count. Review metrics monthly and adjust policies based on findings. Conduct annual governance maturity assessments.
