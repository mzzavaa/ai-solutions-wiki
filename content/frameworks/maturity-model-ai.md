An AI maturity model provides a structured assessment of where an organization stands in its AI journey and what capabilities it needs to develop next. The model defines progressive levels of maturity across multiple dimensions, giving leadership a shared vocabulary for current state and a roadmap for improvement. This framework defines five levels across five dimensions, producing a practical assessment that informs AI strategy and investment priorities.

## The Five Maturity Levels

**Level 1: Exploring** - The organization is investigating AI possibilities. Individual teams may be experimenting with AI tools (ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot) but there is no coordinated strategy, no dedicated budget, and no production AI systems. AI discussions are happening but have not produced commitments.

**Level 2: Experimenting** - The organization has funded one or more AI proof-of-concept projects. Data scientists or ML engineers have been hired or contracted. POCs demonstrate feasibility but have not reached production. There is growing awareness of data quality and infrastructure requirements.

**Level 3: Operationalizing** - One or more AI systems are running in production. MLOps practices are emerging: model monitoring, retraining pipelines, and CI/CD for models. An AI platform team may be forming. The organization has learned from production deployments and is developing institutional knowledge.

**Level 4: Scaling** - AI is embedded in multiple business processes. Shared AI infrastructure (feature stores, model serving platforms, evaluation frameworks) supports multiple teams. Governance policies cover model risk, bias, and data usage. The organization can deploy new AI use cases in weeks rather than months because foundational infrastructure exists.

**Level 5: Transforming** - AI is a core business capability that shapes strategy. The organization uses AI to create new products, enter new markets, or fundamentally redesign operations. AI governance is mature with board-level oversight. The talent pipeline, infrastructure, and processes are optimized for continuous AI innovation.

## The Five Assessment Dimensions

### Technology

Assesses the AI/ML infrastructure, tools, and platforms available.

- Level 1: No dedicated AI infrastructure. Ad-hoc use of laptops and free APIs.
- Level 3: Cloud-based ML platform (SageMaker, Vertex AI). Shared compute resources. Model serving infrastructure.
- Level 5: Fully automated MLOps pipeline. Self-service AI platform. Real-time feature stores. Automated monitoring and retraining.

### Data

Assesses data quality, accessibility, and management practices.

- Level 1: Data is siloed, inconsistent, and poorly documented. No data catalog.
- Level 3: Key datasets are documented and accessible. Data quality monitoring exists for critical pipelines. Data governance policies are defined.
- Level 5: Enterprise data mesh or data fabric. Automated data quality. Real-time data availability. Data contracts between producers and consumers.

### People

Assesses AI talent, skills, and organizational structure.

- Level 1: No dedicated AI roles. Interest but no expertise.
- Level 3: Dedicated data scientists and ML engineers. Skills are concentrated in one team.
- Level 5: AI skills distributed across the organization. AI literacy programs for non-technical staff. Clear career paths for AI roles. Centers of excellence that share knowledge.

### Process

Assesses how AI projects are managed and delivered.

- Level 1: No defined process for AI projects. Ad-hoc experimentation.
- Level 3: AI project lifecycle defined (from ideation to production). Use case prioritization framework in place. Sprint methodology adapted for AI work.
- Level 5: Automated model lifecycle management. Continuous evaluation and improvement. Rapid experimentation infrastructure. Portfolio management for AI initiatives.

### Governance

Assesses AI risk management, ethics, and compliance practices.

- Level 1: No AI governance. No awareness of AI-specific risks.
- Level 3: AI ethics guidelines documented. Model risk assessment for production models. Bias testing included in deployment process.
- Level 5: AI governance board with executive sponsorship. Automated compliance checks. Third-party model audits. Transparent AI reporting to stakeholders.

## Running the Assessment

Conduct the assessment through structured interviews with 8-12 stakeholders across technology, data, business, and leadership roles. For each dimension, gather evidence (not just opinions) of current capabilities. Score each dimension independently on the 1-5 scale.

Present results as a radar chart showing the five dimensions, highlighting the gaps between current state and target state. The biggest gap indicates the highest priority investment area.

## Using the Results

Maturity gaps inform strategy. An organization at Level 3 in Technology but Level 1 in Governance should invest in governance before scaling further. An organization at Level 4 in Data but Level 2 in People needs to hire or train AI talent to capitalize on their data advantage.

Do not try to advance all dimensions simultaneously. Focus on the dimension that is most constraining progress and invest there first.
