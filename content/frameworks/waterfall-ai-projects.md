Waterfall methodology moves through sequential phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase must be completed and approved before the next begins. In the AI community, waterfall is often dismissed as incompatible with the iterative nature of ML development. This is partially true but ignores the reality that many enterprise AI projects operate in environments where waterfall is not a choice but a constraint: regulated industries, government contracts, and organizations with phase-gated governance.

## When Waterfall Is Imposed

**Regulatory requirements** - Healthcare, financial services, and government projects often require phase-gated reviews with formal sign-offs before proceeding. Model validation must be completed and documented before deployment is approved. These requirements exist for good reasons and cannot be bypassed.

**Fixed-scope contracts** - Many consulting and vendor engagements specify deliverables, milestones, and acceptance criteria upfront. The contract structure is waterfall even if the development methodology is not. Understanding how to operate within this constraint is a practical skill.

**Organizational governance** - Large enterprises often have investment review boards that require stage-gate approvals at defined project phases. An AI project must present a business case at gate 1, a technical design at gate 2, and validated results at gate 3 before production deployment is approved.

## Adapting Waterfall Phases for AI

**Requirements phase** - Define the business problem, success metrics, data requirements, and constraints. For AI projects, add: data availability assessment, ethical review, bias risk evaluation, and model performance thresholds. The requirements document should explicitly state what accuracy level constitutes success and what happens if that level is not achievable.

**Design phase** - Specify the technical architecture: data pipeline, model approach, training infrastructure, serving infrastructure, monitoring, and rollback procedures. Include a model selection rationale (why this algorithm or model type). Document the evaluation methodology: what test data will be used, what metrics will be measured, and what thresholds must be met.

**Implementation phase** - Build the data pipeline, train the model, and develop the application. This is where the tension with waterfall is greatest. Model training is inherently iterative: you cannot guarantee the design will produce a model that meets requirements. Mitigate this by including iteration cycles within the implementation phase (mini-sprints for model experimentation) while maintaining the external appearance of sequential progress for governance purposes.

**Testing phase** - Model validation against the defined evaluation methodology. For regulated environments, this includes bias testing across demographic groups, stress testing with adversarial inputs, and performance benchmarking against baseline systems. Document results in a validation report that satisfies regulatory reviewers.

**Deployment phase** - Production deployment with monitoring, rollback procedures, and a defined period of parallel operation (new model running alongside the existing system). Post-deployment monitoring for a defined period before the old system is decommissioned.

## Phase Gate Reviews

At each gate, present evidence that the phase is complete and the project should proceed:

- **Gate 1 (Requirements to Design)** - Business case approved, data available, ethical review passed, success criteria defined.
- **Gate 2 (Design to Implementation)** - Architecture reviewed, risk assessment complete, resource plan approved.
- **Gate 3 (Implementation to Testing)** - Model trained, preliminary performance metrics meet minimum thresholds, integration code complete.
- **Gate 4 (Testing to Deployment)** - Validation report approved, bias testing passed, deployment plan reviewed, rollback procedures tested.

## The Hybrid Approach

The practical approach for most enterprise AI projects is waterfall at the project level and iterative at the technical level. External stakeholders and governance boards see sequential phases with gate reviews. Internally, the team runs iterative cycles of experimentation, evaluation, and refinement within each phase. This is not deceptive; it is pragmatic. The phase structure provides governance and accountability. The internal iteration provides the flexibility that AI development requires.

## Risks and Mitigations

The primary risk of waterfall for AI is committing to requirements before understanding feasibility. Mitigate this by including a funded feasibility study before the formal project begins. The feasibility study (typically 2-4 weeks) explores the data, builds a baseline model, and produces a realistic assessment of what is achievable. This evidence informs the requirements phase and prevents the project from committing to unachievable targets.

## When to Use This Framework

Use waterfall (or a waterfall hybrid) when external governance requires phase-gated approvals, when contracts specify sequential deliverables, or when the organization's PMO mandates waterfall methodology. Do not use pure waterfall for exploratory AI projects where the feasibility of the approach is unknown.
