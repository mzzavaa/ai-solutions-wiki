The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, focuses on validated learning through rapid experimentation. Build a minimum viable product (MVP), measure how customers respond, and learn whether your hypothesis is correct. For AI projects, Lean Startup addresses a critical risk: investing months in model development only to discover that the problem does not matter to users, the data does not exist at scale, or the business model does not work. Lean Startup de-risks AI investment by testing assumptions before committing to full development.

## The Core Loop: Build-Measure-Learn

The Lean Startup loop applied to AI:

**Build** - Create the simplest possible version of the AI solution that tests your riskiest assumption. This is not a production-ready model. It might be a prompt-based prototype, a rules-based approximation, or a human-powered simulation of what the AI would do.

**Measure** - Collect data on user behavior, not opinions. Do users complete tasks faster? Do they use the feature daily or abandon it after the first try? Do they pay for it? Define metrics before building.

**Learn** - Analyze the data and decide: persevere (the hypothesis is confirmed, invest more), pivot (the problem is real but the solution is wrong, change approach), or stop (the problem is not significant enough to pursue).

## AI-Specific Hypotheses to Test

Before building an AI model, test these hypotheses:

**Problem hypothesis** - "Users have this problem, and it is painful enough to change behavior." Test by interviewing users, observing workflows, and measuring the current cost of the problem. Many AI projects fail because the problem exists but is not painful enough for users to adopt a new tool.

**Data hypothesis** - "Sufficient data exists at the required quality to train an effective model." Test by accessing sample data, profiling it for quality, and running baseline experiments. Data issues kill more AI projects than algorithmic challenges.

**Performance hypothesis** - "An AI model can achieve accuracy sufficient for this use case." Test by building a quick baseline model and evaluating its performance. If a simple model achieves 70% and the business requires 95%, the gap may be unbridgeable.

**Adoption hypothesis** - "Users will trust and use AI-generated outputs in their workflow." Test with Wizard of Oz prototypes or human-in-the-loop systems. Even accurate AI is worthless if users do not trust it.

**Business model hypothesis** - "The AI solution generates enough value to justify its cost." Test by calculating the cost of the AI system (compute, data, maintenance) against the measured value (time saved, revenue generated, cost avoided).

## The AI MVP

An AI MVP is not a fully trained production model. It is the cheapest, fastest way to test your riskiest assumption.

**Concierge MVP** - A human performs the task the AI would perform, while the user interacts with the product interface. This tests whether the output is valuable without building any model.

**Prompt MVP** - Use an LLM with a crafted prompt to generate outputs. No training, no infrastructure, just an API call. This tests the quality of outputs and user response.

**Rules-based MVP** - Use simple rules and heuristics instead of ML. If rules achieve 70% accuracy and users find the output valuable, it validates the use case. ML can then improve accuracy over time.

**Existing model MVP** - Use a pre-trained model (Hugging Face, cloud AI APIs) without fine-tuning. Test whether the out-of-the-box performance is sufficient or close enough to validate the concept.

## Pivot Types for AI

When the data says your current approach is not working, consider AI-specific pivots:

**Problem pivot** - The solution works, but a different problem is more valuable. Your document classifier works great, but users actually need document search.

**Data pivot** - The model needs different data than initially planned. Switch from structured data to unstructured text, or from internal data to enriched external data.

**Architecture pivot** - The model approach is wrong. Switch from custom training to RAG, from classification to generation, or from real-time to batch.

**Human-in-the-loop pivot** - Full automation is not achievable at the required quality. Pivot to an AI-assisted workflow where the model handles 80% and a human handles the rest.

## When to Use Lean Startup for AI

Use Lean Startup when building a new AI product or feature where user adoption is uncertain. It is less applicable for internal infrastructure projects (the "user" is the engineering team, whose needs are known) or for well-understood ML applications (fraud detection in a bank that already has fraud models).
