OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) connect aspirational goals to measurable outcomes. An Objective is a qualitative statement of what you want to achieve. Key Results are quantitative measures that indicate whether you have achieved it. For AI programs, OKRs bridge the gap between executive AI ambitions ("become an AI-driven organization") and the concrete, measurable progress that engineering teams can deliver and leadership can track.

## Why OKRs Work for AI Programs

AI programs suffer from two measurement problems. First, technical metrics (model accuracy, F1 score) do not resonate with business stakeholders. Second, business metrics (revenue, cost reduction) are often too distant from the AI team's work to be actionable. OKRs address this by creating a hierarchy: business-level objectives with AI-specific key results, and AI-level objectives with technical key results.

## Structure: Business to AI Alignment

**Company-level Objective**: "Deliver exceptional customer service efficiency."

**Business Key Results**:
- Reduce average support ticket resolution time from 4 hours to 2 hours.
- Increase first-contact resolution rate from 60% to 80%.
- Reduce support cost per ticket from $12 to $8.

**AI Team Objective**: "Deploy AI-powered support automation that resolves simple tickets without agent involvement."

**AI Key Results**:
- Deploy automated ticket classification with >92% accuracy by end of Q2.
- Achieve 30% ticket deflection rate through AI self-service by end of Q3.
- Maintain customer satisfaction score above 4.2/5 for AI-resolved tickets.

This hierarchy connects the AI team's work to business outcomes while giving the AI team measurable targets within their control.

## Writing Good AI Key Results

**Avoid purely technical KRs** - "Train a model with 95% accuracy" is an activity, not an outcome. "Reduce manual document review time by 50% through AI-assisted extraction" connects technical work to business value.

**Include adoption KRs** - "80% of agents use the AI suggestion feature daily" measures whether the AI is actually being used, not just deployed. Many AI projects succeed technically but fail at adoption.

**Include operational KRs** - "Model serves predictions with <200ms latency at P99" and "Model drift monitoring alerts trigger for <5% of weekly checks" measure production readiness, not just model quality.

**Set stretch targets** - OKRs should be ambitious. Achieving 70% of key results is considered successful in the OKR methodology. If the team achieves 100% consistently, the targets are too conservative.

## Common AI OKR Patterns

**Exploration quarter** - Objective: "Validate AI feasibility for top 3 use cases." KRs: Complete data assessment for 3 use cases, build baseline models for 2 use cases, present feasibility findings to steering committee.

**Build quarter** - Objective: "Deliver production-ready AI for [use case]." KRs: Deploy model to production with >X% accuracy, integrate into user workflow with <Y ms latency, onboard Z users in pilot program.

**Scale quarter** - Objective: "Maximize business impact of deployed AI." KRs: Expand from pilot to full deployment (N users), achieve X% improvement in business metric, reduce operational cost of AI system by Y%.

**Platform quarter** - Objective: "Build shared AI infrastructure." KRs: Deploy shared feature store supporting N teams, reduce model deployment time from X days to Y hours, implement automated model monitoring for all production models.

## OKR Cadence for AI

Quarterly OKRs work well for AI teams, with one caveat: research-heavy work may not produce measurable outcomes every quarter. For teams doing significant exploration, use half-year OKRs for research objectives and quarterly OKRs for delivery objectives.

Review OKRs mid-quarter to assess progress and adjust if assumptions have changed. AI projects frequently discover mid-quarter that the data does not support the original plan, requiring a key result adjustment.

## Anti-Patterns

**Vanity KRs** - "Build 5 models" measures activity, not value. Focus on outcomes delivered.

**Missing the user** - Technical KRs without adoption or satisfaction metrics. A model nobody uses delivers zero value regardless of accuracy.

**Ignoring maintenance** - OKRs that focus only on new development without allocating capacity for maintaining existing models. Production models degrade over time and need monitoring, retraining, and infrastructure maintenance.

## When to Use OKRs for AI

Use OKRs when the organization already uses OKRs (adding AI-specific OKRs into the existing framework), when aligning multiple teams around AI goals, or when communicating AI progress to non-technical leadership. If the organization does not use OKRs, introducing them solely for AI adds process overhead without organizational alignment benefit.
