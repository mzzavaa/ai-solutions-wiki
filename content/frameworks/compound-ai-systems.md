The term "compound AI system" describes an AI system that combines multiple components -- language models, retrievers, code executors, tools, and programmatic control logic -- to accomplish tasks that no single model can handle reliably on its own. The concept was formalized by researchers at Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) in 2024, reflecting a shift in how production AI systems are built: away from monolithic models and toward systems of interacting components.

## Why Single Models Are Not Enough

Large language models are remarkably capable, but they have fundamental limitations in production settings. They hallucinate facts, cannot access real-time data, struggle with precise calculations, have fixed knowledge cutoffs, and produce inconsistent outputs across runs. Each of these limitations can be addressed by combining the model with other components: a retriever for grounding in current data, a calculator for precise arithmetic, a code executor for deterministic logic, and a verification layer for consistency checking.

The compound AI systems framework recognizes that the most effective production AI systems are not better models but better systems that use models as one component among many.

## Core Components

A compound AI system typically includes several types of components:

**Language models** serve as the reasoning and generation backbone. A system may use multiple models: a fast, inexpensive model for simple tasks and a larger, more capable model for complex reasoning. Model routing logic determines which model handles which request.

**Retrievers** provide access to external knowledge. This includes vector databases for semantic search, traditional search engines for keyword matching, and structured database queries for precise data retrieval. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pattern is the most common example of a compound system.

**Tools** extend the system's capabilities beyond text generation. Tools include code interpreters, web browsers, API connectors, calculators, and domain-specific software. The model decides when and how to use tools based on the task requirements.

**Control logic** orchestrates the interaction between components. This may be as simple as a fixed pipeline (retrieve, then generate, then verify) or as complex as an agent loop where the model dynamically decides which actions to take next. Control logic also handles error recovery, retries, and fallback strategies.

**Evaluation and verification** components check the quality of outputs before they reach the user. This includes fact-checking against retrieved sources, consistency validation across multiple generations, format verification, and safety filtering.

## Design Patterns

Several patterns have emerged for structuring compound AI systems:

**Pipeline architecture** arranges components in a fixed sequence. Input flows through retrieval, augmentation, generation, and verification stages in order. This is the simplest architecture to build and debug but offers limited flexibility.

**Router architecture** uses a classifier or model to route requests to different processing paths based on the input characteristics. Simple queries go to a fast path; complex queries go to a multi-step reasoning path. This optimizes cost and latency without sacrificing quality on difficult inputs.

**Agent architecture** gives a language model the ability to dynamically choose which tools to invoke, in what order, and how many times. The model operates in a loop: observe, think, act, observe the result, and decide whether to continue or return a final answer. This is the most flexible architecture but also the hardest to control and predict.

**Ensemble architecture** runs multiple models or processing paths in parallel and combines their outputs through voting, ranking, or synthesis. This improves reliability at the cost of increased latency and compute.

## Why This Framework Matters

The compound AI systems framework shifts the optimization target from model quality to system quality. Improving a production AI system may involve better prompting, better retrieval, better tool integration, or better control logic -- not necessarily a better model. This insight has practical implications for how teams allocate engineering effort and how organizations think about their AI architecture. It also means that AI system development requires software engineering skills alongside ML expertise, because much of the system's behavior is determined by code rather than model weights.
