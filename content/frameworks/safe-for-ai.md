The Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) provides structure for coordinating multiple Agile teams working toward shared objectives. When an organization runs not one but five or fifteen AI initiatives simultaneously, SAFe's portfolio, program, and team layers help align investment decisions, manage dependencies, and coordinate delivery across teams. This article covers how to adapt SAFe's practices for the specific characteristics of AI and ML programs.

## Why SAFe Becomes Relevant for AI

Single-team AI projects rarely need SAFe. The framework becomes relevant when: multiple teams work on related AI initiatives (a recommendation engine team, a search team, and a personalization team sharing data infrastructure), AI is part of a larger product delivery (AI features embedded in a multi-team product), or the organization manages an AI portfolio with investment allocation decisions across competing initiatives.

## Portfolio Level Adaptations

At the portfolio level, SAFe manages the flow of AI initiatives through a Kanban system with stages like Funnel, Analyzing, Portfolio Backlog, Implementing, and Done. For AI, add a **Feasibility** stage between Analyzing and Portfolio Backlog. AI initiatives should pass a feasibility gate (data available? problem tractable? performance target realistic?) before consuming portfolio capacity.

**Lean Business Cases** for AI initiatives must include: the data assets required (do they exist? what quality?), the performance threshold that constitutes business value, the ongoing operational cost of the AI system (not just build cost), and the fallback plan if model performance does not meet targets.

**Portfolio-level metrics** for AI programs should include: number of models in production, model reliability (uptime and accuracy maintenance), time from concept to production deployment, and AI-driven business metrics (revenue influenced, cost saved, time reduced).

## PI Planning Adaptations

Program Increment (PI) Planning is where SAFe's rubber meets the road. For AI programs, standard PI planning needs several adjustments:

**Uncertainty buffers** - Allocate 20-30% of capacity to unplanned work and experimentation. AI work generates discoveries that change plans mid-PI. Without buffers, teams either miss commitments or stop experimenting.

**Data dependencies** - Map data dependencies explicitly during PI planning. AI teams depend on data pipelines, labeling teams, and data governance approvals. These dependencies are often cross-team or cross-department and take longer to resolve than software dependencies.

**Shared infrastructure objectives** - Dedicate PI objectives to shared AI infrastructure: feature stores, model serving platforms, monitoring systems, and evaluation frameworks. Without explicit objectives for infrastructure, each team builds ad-hoc solutions that become maintenance burdens.

**Research spikes as features** - Include research spikes (timeboxed investigations) as first-class features in the PI plan. These produce knowledge and feasibility assessments, not code. They are legitimate PI outputs and should be planned, estimated, and reviewed.

## Agile Release Train for AI

The Agile Release Train (ART) groups teams that deliver together. For AI programs, the ART might include: a data engineering team (pipelines, data quality), a model development team (training, evaluation), an ML platform team (serving infrastructure, monitoring), and application integration teams (embedding AI into products).

The system demo at the end of each iteration should include model performance dashboards alongside application demos. Stakeholders should see both the model's current accuracy and how it performs in the user-facing application.

## Common SAFe Anti-Patterns in AI

**Over-planning model work** - Committing to specific model accuracy targets for the full PI. Commit to the process (run N experiments, evaluate M approaches) rather than the outcome (achieve X% accuracy).

**Ignoring the innovation layer** - SAFe includes time for innovation and planning (typically the last iteration in a PI). AI teams should use this time for exploration: testing new techniques, evaluating new models, and prototyping ideas that do not fit in committed PI objectives.

**Treating AI as a feature factory** - Applying SAFe's throughput optimization to AI without recognizing that some AI work is research. Research has different cadence and predictability than feature development.

## When to Use SAFe for AI

SAFe adds value when multiple AI teams need coordination, when AI is embedded in larger product programs, and when the organization's existing delivery framework is SAFe. It adds overhead and process that is not justified for small, independent AI teams. If one team is building one model, use Agile AI Delivery instead.
