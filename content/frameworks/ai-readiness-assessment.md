The most common reason AI projects stall is not the technology - it is organizational unreadiness. A team that starts building before assessing its foundations tends to discover blockers mid-project: data that cannot be accessed, a security review that adds six months, or executives who withdraw support when the first prototype does not match their expectations. This assessment is designed to surface those issues before they become blockers.

## The Five Dimensions

### 1. Data Maturity

AI systems are only as good as the data feeding them. This dimension assesses not just whether data exists, but whether it is accessible, clean, and well-governed.

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Is the relevant data stored in a system your team can query directly, or does every data request require a ticket to another team?
- Do you have documented data definitions and ownership for the datasets the AI would use?
- Is historical data available for at least 12 months, with consistent schema?
- Have you identified any data quality issues (duplicates, missing values, inconsistent formats) in the relevant datasets?

**Red flags:** Data locked in PDFs or legacy systems with no API, no documented data owners, multiple conflicting sources of truth for the same entity.

### 2. Team Skills

You do not need a team of ML PhDs to run an AI project. But you do need people who can work with APIs, evaluate model outputs critically, and understand basic prompt engineering concepts.

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Does your team include at least one developer comfortable with REST APIs and cloud services?
- Can someone on the team evaluate AI-generated outputs for accuracy - not just "does it look right" but systematically, at scale?
- Is there a product owner who can translate business requirements into clear AI task definitions?

**Red flags:** Every technical task must be outsourced, no one has worked with AI tools before, product owners cannot articulate what "correct" output looks like.

### 3. Infrastructure Readiness

Can your current cloud and security setup support an AI workload?

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Do you have an AWS, Azure, or GCP account with appropriate service limits for AI/ML workloads?
- Is there a clear process for getting new cloud services approved by security?
- Can you store and process the required data in the cloud, or are there data residency restrictions?

### 4. Executive Buy-In

AI projects that lack executive sponsorship rarely survive the first setback.

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Is there a named executive sponsor who will defend the project budget in quarterly reviews?
- Does leadership understand that the first prototype is for learning, not production deployment?
- Is there appetite to accept a 3-6 month timeline before seeing measurable ROI?

### 5. Use Case Clarity

Vague use cases produce vague AI systems. This dimension assesses whether the problem is defined precisely enough to be solved.

**Self-assessment questions:**
- Can you describe the current manual process step by step?
- Do you have a clear definition of what a correct AI output looks like?
- Is there a measurable success metric that does not depend on subjective judgment?

## Interpreting the Results

Score each dimension 1-5. A total score of 20-25 indicates strong readiness - start with a full prototype. 13-19 suggests partial readiness - address the lowest-scoring dimension before beginning. Under 13 indicates that organizational groundwork is needed before any technical investment will pay off.

The assessment is not a gate - it is a map. The goal is to show teams where to invest first so that the technical work has the foundation it needs to succeed.
