Prompts are code. They define the behavior of your AI system as directly as any function or API endpoint. Yet most teams manage prompts in ad-hoc ways - hard-coded strings in application code, Google Docs shared among team members, or configuration files with no version history. This works for one prompt. It does not work for fifty.

## Prompts as Code

Store prompt templates in version control alongside application code. Each prompt template is a file with a defined schema: the template text with variable placeholders, metadata (model target, temperature, max tokens), and a description of the prompt's purpose and expected behavior.

**Template format** - Use a structured format that separates the prompt text from its configuration. YAML or JSON files work well. Include the system message, user message template with placeholder variables, model parameters, and a human-readable description of what the prompt does and what good output looks like.

**Variable injection** - Prompt templates include placeholders for dynamic content (user input, retrieved context, system state). Use a templating engine (Jinja2, Handlebars) rather than string concatenation. This prevents injection issues and makes the template's interface explicit.

## Version Control Strategy

**Branching model** - Treat prompt changes like code changes. Create branches for prompt modifications, review changes via pull requests, and merge to main for production deployment. This creates an audit trail and enables rollback.

**Semantic versioning** - Version prompts semantically. A minor change (rewording for clarity without behavioral change) is a patch version. A moderate change (adding a new output field, changing formatting) is a minor version. A fundamental behavioral change (different classification categories, changed decision logic) is a major version.

**Change documentation** - Each prompt change should document: what changed, why it changed, what behavior is expected to differ, and test results comparing old and new versions. This documentation is invaluable when debugging production behavior changes.

## Testing Prompts

**Evaluation datasets** - Maintain test datasets for each prompt template: a set of inputs with expected outputs (or expected output characteristics). Run the test suite against every prompt change before merging. Use both exact match tests (for structured outputs) and quality scoring tests (for generative outputs).

**Regression testing** - When modifying a prompt, run the full test suite to ensure the change does not degrade performance on existing test cases while improving the targeted behavior. Prompt changes often have surprising side effects.

**A/B comparison** - For significant prompt changes, run the old and new prompts on the same input set and compare outputs side by side. Automated quality metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, custom rubrics) provide quantitative comparison, but human review of a sample is essential for catching quality issues metrics miss.

## Deployment

**Decoupled deployment** - Deploy prompt templates independently from application code. Store templates in a configuration service or feature flag system that allows prompt updates without application redeployment. This enables rapid iteration on prompts without the overhead of a full deployment cycle.

**Gradual rollout** - Roll out prompt changes gradually. Start at 5-10% of traffic, monitor quality metrics, and increase traffic if metrics are stable. This catches issues that test datasets miss because production traffic is always more diverse than test data.

**Rollback capability** - Maintain the ability to instantly revert to the previous prompt version. Monitor key quality metrics after deployment and trigger automatic rollback if metrics degrade beyond defined thresholds. The rollback path should be tested and automated, not a manual emergency procedure.

## Multi-Prompt Systems

Complex AI applications use many prompts in orchestration. Managing these as a coherent system adds challenges.

**Dependency tracking** - Document which prompts feed into other prompts. A change to an upstream prompt's output format can break downstream prompts that parse that output. Test the full chain when any prompt in the chain changes.

**Consistent versioning** - Track which combination of prompt versions was deployed together. When debugging an issue, you need to know exactly which version of every prompt was active at the time.
