Every AI system has a finite useful life. Models degrade as data distributions shift. Regulations change. Better alternatives emerge. Yet most organizations invest heavily in deploying AI systems and give almost no thought to retiring them. The decommissioning pattern provides a structured approach to sunsetting AI systems safely, preserving compliance artifacts, and avoiding disruption to dependent services.

## Origins and History

System decommissioning as a formal practice emerged from IT asset management and enterprise architecture disciplines in the 1990s, when organizations began grappling with legacy system retirement during Y2K remediation and ERP migrations [1]. The practice gained regulatory weight in financial services through requirements in Basel II (2004) and SOX (2002), which mandated audit trail preservation even after systems were retired [2]. As AI systems entered regulated industries in the 2010s, decommissioning became more complex because models carry additional artifacts (training data, evaluation datasets, model weights) that may be subject to data retention or deletion requirements. The EU AI Act (proposed 2021, adopted 2024) introduced explicit lifecycle management expectations for high-risk AI systems, including requirements that extend beyond a system's operational life [3].

## When to Decommission

Decommission an AI system when model performance has degraded below acceptable thresholds and retraining is not cost-justified, when a successor system has been validated and is ready to assume the workload, when regulatory or policy changes make the system non-compliant, or when the business use case the system served no longer exists.

## Decommissioning Steps

**Stakeholder notification** begins well before the system goes offline. Identify all consumers: downstream services, business teams, reporting pipelines, and external partners. Provide a deprecation timeline with clear milestones and a final shutdown date.

**Traffic migration** redirects requests from the retiring system to its replacement. Use a gradual cutover: route a small percentage of traffic to the new system, validate outputs, and increase the percentage over days or weeks. Monitor both systems during the transition for discrepancies.

**Model archival** preserves the model weights, configuration, evaluation results, and associated metadata in long-term storage. Even after a model is no longer serving traffic, organizations may need to reproduce its outputs for regulatory inquiries or dispute resolution. Tag archived artifacts with the model's operational dates and approved use cases.

**Data cleanup** addresses training data, cached responses, and user interaction logs. Regulatory requirements may mandate retention periods (financial services records often require seven years) or deletion deadlines (GDPR right to erasure). Reconcile these competing requirements before deleting any data.

**Audit trail preservation** ensures that governance records, validation reports, incident logs, and change history remain accessible after the system is retired. These records demonstrate that the system was operated responsibly during its lifetime.

## Safeguards

**Rollback provisions** maintain the ability to restore the retired system for a defined period after shutdown. Keep infrastructure-as-code templates and container images available so the system can be redeployed if the replacement fails unexpectedly.

**Knowledge transfer** documents the institutional knowledge that the retiring system embodied: why certain design decisions were made, known edge cases, and lessons learned. This information helps the team operating the successor system avoid repeating mistakes.

**Post-decommission monitoring** watches for residual dependencies that were missed during stakeholder analysis. Monitor for failed API calls to the retired endpoint, orphaned scheduled jobs, and references in documentation or runbooks that still point to the old system.
