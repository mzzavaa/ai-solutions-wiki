ML models degrade in production. The data distribution shifts, user behavior changes, and the relationship between features and targets evolves. A model that performed well at deployment time may be making poor predictions weeks later without anyone noticing. The self-healing model pattern automates the detection of degradation and triggers corrective action without waiting for a human to investigate.

## Degradation Signals

**Data drift** - The statistical distribution of input features changes relative to the training distribution. Monitor feature distributions using KL divergence, Population Stability Index (PSI), or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. A significant shift in input distribution is an early warning that model accuracy may degrade.

**Prediction drift** - The distribution of model outputs changes even if input distributions appear stable. A classification model that suddenly predicts one class 80% of the time when it historically predicted 50% may be experiencing concept drift.

**Performance degradation** - Direct measurement of model accuracy against ground truth labels, when available. For systems with delayed labels (fraud detection, churn prediction), track proxy metrics that correlate with true performance.

**Latency regression** - Inference latency increases due to input complexity changes, infrastructure degradation, or resource contention. Monitor p50, p95, and p99 latency and alert on sustained increases.

## Automated Response Tiers

**Tier 1 - Alert** - Drift is detected but below the action threshold. Notify the ML team via standard alerting channels. Log the drift metrics for trend analysis. No automated action is taken.

**Tier 2 - Fallback** - Performance has degraded past the acceptable threshold. Automatically route traffic to a fallback model (previous stable version, simpler baseline, or rule-based system) while the primary model is investigated. This limits user impact during the remediation window.

**Tier 3 - Retrain** - Trigger an automated retraining pipeline using recent production data. The pipeline trains a new model version, evaluates it against the current model, and promotes it if it passes all quality gates. If the retrained model does not improve on the current version, escalate to the ML team for manual investigation.

## Implementation Components

Deploy a monitoring service that continuously evaluates drift metrics against incoming production data. Use a sliding window of recent predictions compared against a reference distribution from the training set or a recent known-good period.

Connect the monitoring service to an orchestrator that maps drift severity to response actions. The orchestrator consults a policy configuration that defines thresholds for each tier. Use a state machine to track the current health state of each model and prevent redundant retraining triggers.

## Guardrails on Automation

Automated retraining must have safety checks. Set a maximum retraining frequency to prevent runaway automation. Require that retrained models pass the same evaluation gates as manually trained models. Never promote a retrained model that scores below the current production model, even if the current model is degraded.
