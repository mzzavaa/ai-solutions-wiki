Manual compliance checks do not scale with the pace of AI development. This pattern describes an automated compliance monitoring architecture that continuously evaluates AI systems against regulatory requirements and organizational policies.

## Pattern Overview

A compliance monitoring platform ingests signals from AI infrastructure, model registries, data pipelines, and security tools. It evaluates these signals against codified compliance rules and generates alerts, reports, and audit trails. The platform operates continuously, not as a periodic audit.

## Compliance Rules Engine

Codify regulatory requirements as machine-executable rules. Examples: every model in the registry must have a completed DPIA reference (GDPR), high-risk AI systems must have human oversight configuration documented (EU AI Act), training data buckets must have encryption enabled and access logging active (NIS2/DORA), model serving endpoints must not be publicly accessible without authentication (NIS2), and automated decisions must route through a human review queue when confidence is below a threshold (GDPR Article 22).

Use a policy-as-code framework (Open Policy Agent, AWS Config custom rules, or a dedicated compliance engine) to express these rules. Version control the rules alongside the regulations they implement. When regulations are updated, update the rules and redeploy.

## Signal Collection

Collect compliance-relevant signals from multiple sources. **Infrastructure signals** from CSPM tools, cloud provider APIs, and IaC scanning: resource configurations, encryption status, network exposure, access policies. **Model registry signals**: model metadata, DPIA references, lineage documentation, evaluation results, approval status. **Data pipeline signals**: data lineage records, consent status, retention compliance, access logs. **Runtime signals**: inference logs, human review completion rates, model performance metrics, incident records. **Security signals**: vulnerability scan results, penetration test findings, threat detection alerts.

## Evaluation and Scoring

The compliance engine evaluates collected signals against the rules continuously. For each AI system, it produces a compliance score broken down by regulation (GDPR, EU AI Act, NIS2, DORA) and by requirement category (data protection, security, transparency, governance). Non-compliant findings are classified by severity: critical (immediate regulatory risk), high (must be addressed within days), medium (should be addressed within weeks), and low (improvement opportunity).

## Alerting and Remediation

Critical findings trigger immediate alerts to the responsible team and compliance officer. High findings create tickets in the team's issue tracker with defined SLAs. Where possible, implement automated remediation: auto-encrypt unencrypted storage, auto-block public endpoint exposure, auto-revoke expired access credentials. For findings requiring human judgment (incomplete DPIA, missing human oversight documentation), create guided remediation workflows.

## Audit Trail and Reporting

Maintain an immutable audit trail of all compliance evaluations, findings, remediation actions, and approvals. Generate automated compliance reports for management review, regulator requests, and audit purposes. Reports should show compliance posture over time, trending of findings by category, and evidence of continuous improvement.

## Integration with ML Lifecycle

Embed compliance gates in the ML deployment pipeline. Before a model can be promoted from staging to production, the compliance engine must verify that all required documentation exists, security controls are in place, and no critical compliance findings are outstanding. This prevents non-compliant AI systems from reaching production.
