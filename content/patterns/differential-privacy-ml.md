ML models memorize training data. Large language models can reproduce verbatim passages from their training corpus. Classification models leak information about whether a specific individual was in the training set. Differential privacy provides a mathematical framework for training models that learn statistical patterns from a dataset without memorizing information about any individual record.

## The Core Guarantee

A training algorithm satisfies (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy if the probability of any particular model output changes by at most a factor of e^epsilon when any single training example is added or removed. Epsilon controls the privacy budget: smaller epsilon means stronger privacy but more noise in the model. Delta represents the probability that the guarantee fails entirely and is typically set to a value smaller than 1/n where n is the dataset size.

## How DP-SGD Works

Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) modifies the standard training loop in two ways. First, it clips the gradient contribution of each individual training example to a maximum norm, bounding the influence any single record can have on the model. Second, it adds calibrated Gaussian noise to the aggregated gradients before updating model weights.

The noise scale is determined by the clipping norm, the batch size, and the target privacy budget. A privacy accountant tracks cumulative privacy expenditure across training epochs. When the budget is exhausted, training must stop regardless of model performance.

## Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs

Stronger privacy (smaller epsilon) requires more noise, which degrades model accuracy. In practice, epsilon values between 1 and 10 provide meaningful privacy protection while maintaining reasonable model utility. Epsilon values below 1 provide strong theoretical guarantees but often produce models that are too noisy for production use.

Larger datasets tolerate differential privacy better because the noise is averaged across more examples. This is why differential privacy works well for large-scale pretraining but is harder to apply to fine-tuning on small datasets.

## Implementation Strategies

**Framework-level integration** - Use libraries like Opacus (PyTorch) or TensorFlow Privacy that implement DP-SGD as a drop-in replacement for standard optimizers. These handle gradient clipping, noise addition, and privacy accounting automatically.

**Federated learning with DP** - Combine differential privacy with federated learning so that training data never leaves the source device. Apply local differential privacy at each participant and aggregate noisy updates on the server.

**Privacy budget management** - Treat the privacy budget as a finite resource. Each training run, hyperparameter search, and evaluation query against the private dataset consumes budget. Plan the total budget across the model development lifecycle, not just a single training run.

## When to Use This Pattern

Apply differential privacy when training on sensitive datasets where membership inference or data extraction attacks pose real risks: medical records, financial data, user behavior logs, and any dataset subject to privacy regulations. For public datasets or synthetic data, the overhead of differential privacy is not justified.
