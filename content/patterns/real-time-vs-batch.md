The choice between real-time and batch processing is not binary. Most AI systems need both, applied to different parts of the workload. The right split depends on latency requirements, cost sensitivity, and how the output is consumed.

## Decision Framework

**Real-time when** - The user is waiting for the response. The value of the output decreases rapidly with delay (fraud detection, content moderation, conversational AI). The input volume is manageable within rate limits and cost budgets. Response latency under 5 seconds is required.

**Batch when** - Results are consumed asynchronously (reports, enrichment, analysis). The input volume is large and predictable. Cost optimization matters more than speed. Processing can be scheduled during off-peak hours. Latency of minutes to hours is acceptable.

**Hybrid when** - Different inputs in the same system have different urgency levels. A document processing system might process today's incoming documents in real-time while reprocessing the historical archive in batch.

## Architecture Patterns

**Lambda architecture** - Maintain both a real-time processing path and a batch processing path. Real-time produces approximate results quickly. Batch produces authoritative results with full data later. The batch layer periodically corrects any inaccuracies from the real-time layer.

**Kappa architecture** - Process everything as a stream, but replay the stream for batch-like reprocessing. Simpler than Lambda but requires a streaming infrastructure that can handle both real-time and replay workloads. Works well when the processing logic is identical for both modes.

**Request buffering** - Collect real-time requests for a short window (1-5 seconds) and process them as a micro-batch. This amortizes per-request overhead while maintaining near-real-time latency. Effective when the model supports batch input.

## Cost Comparison

Real-time processing pays the full per-request price for every input. Batch processing can leverage batch API discounts (often 50% cheaper), shared context across multiple inputs in a single call, and off-peak scheduling. For high-volume workloads, the cost difference between real-time and batch processing is substantial.

**Break-even analysis** - Calculate the cost per item for both approaches including infrastructure, API costs, and engineering overhead. For most workloads, if fewer than 20% of items truly need real-time processing, a hybrid approach with selective real-time and default batch is optimal.

## Migration Paths

**Batch to real-time** - Start with batch processing to validate the AI pipeline's accuracy and reliability. Once the pipeline is stable, add a real-time path for urgent items while continuing batch for the rest. Gradually shift traffic to real-time as confidence grows and cost is justified.

**Real-time to batch** - If you discover that most outputs are not consumed immediately, migrate to batch processing for cost savings. This requires identifying which consumers actually need real-time results versus those consuming results asynchronously regardless of delivery speed.

## Operational Considerations

**Monitoring differences** - Real-time systems need latency and error rate monitoring at the request level. Batch systems need throughput, completion time, and failure rate monitoring at the job level. Hybrid systems need both, plus monitoring of the routing logic that decides which path each item takes.

**Failure modes** - Real-time failures are immediately visible to users. Batch failures are silent until someone checks. Build proactive monitoring for batch systems: alert when a batch job takes longer than expected, when failure rates exceed thresholds, or when output quality metrics degrade.
