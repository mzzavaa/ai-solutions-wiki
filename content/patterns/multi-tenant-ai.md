Multi-tenant AI systems serve multiple customers from shared infrastructure. This creates unique challenges: data must be isolated, resources must be fairly allocated, and the system must support per-tenant customization without per-tenant infrastructure.

## Data Isolation

The most critical requirement. One tenant's data must never leak to another tenant, even accidentally through model context, cache contamination, or logging.

**Prompt isolation** - Every model call must include only the requesting tenant's data. In RAG systems, vector search must filter by tenant ID to prevent cross-tenant retrieval. Build tenant isolation into the retrieval layer, not as an afterthought filter on results.

**Cache isolation** - If using semantic caching, tenant ID must be part of the cache key. A cached response generated for Tenant A's data must never be served to Tenant B, even if the query is semantically identical. Separate cache namespaces per tenant are the safest approach.

**Model isolation** - If tenants have custom fine-tuned models, ensure the routing layer directs each request to the correct model. Log the model ID used for each request for audit purposes.

**Logging and monitoring** - Ensure logs, metrics, and traces include tenant context but do not expose one tenant's request content to another tenant's log views. Implement tenant-scoped access controls on all observability data.

## Resource Allocation

Shared infrastructure means shared capacity. Without careful management, one tenant's workload can degrade service for others.

**Per-tenant rate limiting** - Set request rate limits and token limits per tenant based on their subscription tier. Enforce limits at the API gateway level so that a tenant exceeding their limits gets throttled rather than consuming shared capacity.

**Fair queuing** - When the system is at capacity, serve requests from all active tenants fairly rather than processing them in arrival order (which favors high-volume tenants). Weighted fair queuing allows premium tenants higher throughput while ensuring all tenants get service.

**Capacity planning** - Track per-tenant usage trends to forecast capacity needs. A single large tenant onboarding can double your infrastructure requirements. Build headroom for unexpected tenant growth and have auto-scaling policies that respond to aggregate load increases.

## Per-Tenant Customization

Different tenants need different behaviors from the same system.

**Prompt customization** - Allow tenants to customize system prompts, response formats, and output schemas without modifying the shared application code. Store per-tenant prompt templates in a configuration service. Apply the tenant's template at request time.

**Knowledge base customization** - Each tenant brings their own documents, FAQs, and domain knowledge. Store these in tenant-scoped vector collections. The shared RAG pipeline retrieves from the correct tenant's collection based on the request context.

**Model selection** - Different tenants may require different model providers or model versions based on their compliance requirements, cost sensitivity, or performance needs. Allow per-tenant model routing configuration.

## Operational Considerations

**Tenant onboarding** - Automate the provisioning of tenant-specific resources: vector database namespaces, cache namespaces, rate limit configurations, and prompt templates. Manual provisioning does not scale and introduces errors.

**Tenant-scoped monitoring** - Provide each tenant with visibility into their own usage, latency, and error rates without exposing other tenants' data. Build per-tenant dashboards from the shared monitoring infrastructure using tenant ID as a filter dimension.

**Noisy neighbor detection** - Monitor for tenants whose usage patterns degrade shared service quality. Set alerts for individual tenants exceeding expected usage patterns. Have escalation procedures for addressing noisy neighbor situations quickly.
