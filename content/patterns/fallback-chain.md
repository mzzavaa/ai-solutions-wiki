Model APIs go down. Rate limits get hit. Responses come back garbled. A production AI system that depends on a single model provider is one outage away from a complete service failure. The fallback chain pattern defines an ordered sequence of alternative models that the system tries when the primary model is unavailable or produces unacceptable results.

## How It Works

A fallback chain is an ordered list of model configurations. The system tries the first model in the chain. If that call fails or produces a result that does not meet quality criteria, it moves to the next model in the chain. This continues until a model succeeds or the chain is exhausted.

Failure conditions that trigger fallback include:

- HTTP errors (429 rate limit, 500 server error, timeouts)
- Malformed responses that fail parsing
- Content filter triggers
- Low-confidence responses below a score threshold
- Responses that fail deterministic validation checks

## Chain Design

A well-designed fallback chain degrades gracefully from the best option to acceptable alternatives:

**Primary** - Your preferred model. Best quality for your use case, the one you have optimized prompts for. Example: Claude Opus for complex reasoning tasks.

**Secondary** - A capable alternative from a different provider. Different enough that an outage at one provider is unlikely to affect the other. Example: GPT-4o as secondary when Anthropic is primary.

**Tertiary** - A smaller or cheaper model that handles the task adequately if not optimally. Example: Claude Haiku or GPT-4o-mini for degraded but functional responses.

**Deterministic fallback** - A non-LLM fallback for when all models are unavailable. Template-based responses, cached responses, or a simple rules engine. This ensures the user gets something rather than an error.

## Prompt Adaptation

Different models may require different prompts to produce equivalent results. A fallback chain should include prompt templates tailored to each model in the chain. Sending an Anthropic-optimized prompt to a different provider may produce poor results that are not representative of that model's actual capability.

## Timeout Strategy

Each model in the chain gets a timeout budget. The total latency budget for the entire chain constrains how long each individual attempt can take. If your end-to-end latency budget is 10 seconds and you have three models in the chain, each might get 3 seconds before triggering fallback to the next.

## Monitoring and Alerting

Track how often each level of the chain is activated. If the secondary model handles more than a small percentage of traffic, something is wrong with the primary. Alert on fallback rate increases so the team can investigate before the situation worsens.

Log which model ultimately served each request. This is essential for debugging quality issues and for accurate cost accounting, since different models in the chain have different pricing.

## When to Use

Any production system where AI availability directly impacts user experience or business operations. The overhead of maintaining multiple model integrations is small compared to the cost of downtime. Even a two-model chain with a deterministic final fallback dramatically improves reliability.
