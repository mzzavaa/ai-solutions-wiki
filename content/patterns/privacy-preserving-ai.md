Privacy-preserving AI encompasses a family of techniques that enable machine learning while minimizing exposure of sensitive data. These techniques are not mutually exclusive and are often combined to provide layered privacy protection.

## Federated Learning

Federated learning trains a shared model across decentralized data sources without transferring raw data to a central location. Each participant trains the model locally on their data and sends only model updates (gradients or weights) to a central aggregation server. The server combines updates from all participants and distributes the improved global model.

**When to use:** Data cannot leave its origin due to regulation (GDPR, data sovereignty), contractual restrictions, or sensitivity. Multiple organizations want to collaborate on a model without sharing proprietary data. Healthcare, financial services, and cross-border scenarios are common use cases.

**Architecture:** A federated server orchestrates training rounds. Participant nodes download the current global model, train on local data, and upload encrypted model updates. The server aggregates updates using algorithms like Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and publishes the updated global model. Communication is encrypted end-to-end.

**Limitations:** Communication overhead is significant for large models. Non-IID data distributions across participants can reduce model quality. The aggregation server sees model updates, which can in some cases leak information about the training data (addressed by combining with differential privacy).

## Differential Privacy

Differential privacy adds carefully calibrated noise to the training process, providing a mathematical guarantee that the model's outputs do not reveal whether any specific individual's data was included in the training set. The privacy guarantee is parameterized by epsilon: smaller epsilon means stronger privacy but potentially lower model accuracy.

**When to use:** You need a provable privacy guarantee for regulatory compliance or stakeholder assurance. The training data contains sensitive personal information. You want to publish model details (weights, predictions) without risk of individual data extraction.

**Architecture:** Differential privacy is implemented at the training level using frameworks like TensorFlow Privacy, Opacus (PyTorch), or Tumult Analytics. Gradient clipping bounds the contribution of any single record, and Gaussian noise is added to the aggregated gradients before the model update step.

**Limitations:** There is a direct tradeoff between privacy budget (epsilon) and model utility. Very strong privacy guarantees may significantly reduce model accuracy. Tracking cumulative privacy budget across multiple training runs requires careful management.

## Secure Computation

Secure multi-party computation (SMPC) and homomorphic encryption enable computation on encrypted data without decrypting it. Multiple parties can jointly compute a function (like training a model) on their combined data without any party seeing the other parties' inputs.

**When to use:** Multiple organizations need to jointly train a model on combined datasets but no party can access the others' data. Inference must be performed on encrypted data because the model operator should not see the input (for example, medical data processed by a third-party AI service).

**Architecture:** For SMPC, data is split into encrypted shares distributed among computing nodes. Each node performs computations on its share, and results are combined to produce the output. For homomorphic encryption, data is encrypted using a scheme that supports computation on ciphertext, processed by the model, and the encrypted result is returned to the data owner for decryption.

**Limitations:** Computational overhead is substantial, often 100-10,000x slower than plaintext computation. Fully homomorphic encryption remains impractical for complex deep learning models. SMPC requires significant network communication between parties.

## Synthetic Data Generation

Generate artificial datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real data without containing actual personal records. Techniques include generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders, and statistical simulation.

**When to use:** You need training data but access to real personal data is restricted. Development and testing environments need realistic data without privacy risk. You want to augment limited real datasets.

**Architecture:** Train a generative model on the real data in a secure environment. Use the generator to produce synthetic records. Validate that synthetic data preserves necessary statistical properties using utility metrics. Validate privacy by testing for re-identification risk and checking that no synthetic records are too close to real records.

**Limitations:** Synthetic data quality depends on the generative model. Complex relationships in the data may not be faithfully reproduced. Privacy guarantees are empirical unless combined with differential privacy. Regulators may require evidence that synthetic data is genuinely non-personal.

## Combining Techniques

The strongest privacy posture combines multiple techniques. Train with differential privacy for provable guarantees. Use federated learning to keep raw data decentralized. Apply synthetic data for development and testing environments. Use secure computation for sensitive inference scenarios. The right combination depends on the threat model, regulatory requirements, and acceptable performance tradeoffs.
