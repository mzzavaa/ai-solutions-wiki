Traditional data architectures force a choice: store data in a warehouse for reliable analytics or in a data lake for flexible ML workloads. The lakehouse pattern eliminates this choice by adding warehouse-like reliability features (ACID transactions, schema enforcement, time travel) directly to data lake storage. Both analytics queries and ML training jobs read from the same data, in the same format, with the same governance controls.

## The Dual-System Problem

Organizations that maintain separate warehouses and lakes suffer from data duplication, inconsistency, and operational overhead. ETL pipelines copy data from the lake to the warehouse, introducing latency and synchronization bugs. The warehouse version and the lake version of the same dataset diverge. ML models trained on lake data produce different results than dashboards built on warehouse data.

## Lakehouse Architecture

**Open table formats** - Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, or Apache Hudi add metadata layers on top of Parquet files stored in object storage (S3, GCS, ADLS). These formats provide ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel without requiring a proprietary storage engine.

**Schema enforcement and evolution** - Writes are validated against the table schema. New columns can be added without rewriting existing data. Schema changes are versioned so that consumers can handle evolution gracefully.

**Time travel** - Every write creates a new version of the table. Queries can read any historical version by specifying a timestamp or version number. ML training jobs use time travel to create reproducible point-in-time snapshots without copying data.

**Unified access layer** - A query engine (Spark, Trino, Databricks SQL) provides SQL access for analysts and DataFrame access for data scientists. Both groups read from the same underlying tables with the same access controls.

## AI-Specific Benefits

**Reproducible training** - Pin training datasets to a specific table version. Rerunning the training pipeline with the same version number produces the same dataset, enabling reproducibility without maintaining separate dataset snapshots.

**Feature engineering at scale** - Compute features using SQL or Spark transformations directly on lakehouse tables. Write feature tables back to the lakehouse with full schema enforcement and versioning. Downstream models consume features from well-governed tables rather than ad-hoc files.

**Streaming and batch unification** - Lakehouse formats support both batch reads and streaming writes. A single table can receive real-time event data via streaming ingestion and serve both real-time dashboards and batch training jobs.

## Governance

Apply fine-grained access controls at the table, column, and row level. Audit all data access. Use data classification tags to automatically enforce retention and access policies. The lakehouse becomes the single point of governance for both analytics and AI data access.

## When to Adopt

The lakehouse pattern is most valuable when the organization already runs both analytics and ML workloads on overlapping datasets. If you only have one type of workload, a dedicated warehouse or lake may be simpler. The migration path typically starts by adopting an open table format on existing lake storage and gradually consolidating warehouse workloads.
