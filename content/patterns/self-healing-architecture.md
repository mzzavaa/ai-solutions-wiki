Self-healing architecture uses AI to close the loop between failure detection and remediation. Traditional monitoring detects problems and alerts humans. Self-healing systems detect problems, diagnose root causes, select appropriate remediation actions, execute them, and verify recovery - all without human intervention. The AI component replaces the on-call engineer's decision-making for known failure classes.

## The Self-Healing Loop

**Detect** - Monitoring systems identify anomalies: elevated error rates, increased latency, resource exhaustion, failed health checks, unusual traffic patterns. Traditional threshold-based alerts work for known failure modes. ML-based anomaly detection catches novel failures by identifying deviations from learned normal behavior.

**Diagnose** - An AI diagnostic engine correlates signals across systems to determine the root cause. High memory usage plus slow queries plus recent deployment suggests a memory leak in the new code. Elevated error rates across all services plus provider status page alert suggests an upstream dependency outage. The diagnostic model is trained on historical incident data and runbook knowledge.

**Decide** - Based on the diagnosis, the system selects a remediation action from a predefined playbook. Restart the service, roll back the deployment, scale up instances, failover to a secondary region, or throttle incoming traffic. The decision must consider blast radius: the remediation should not cause more damage than the original failure.

**Act** - Execute the remediation through existing infrastructure automation (Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes operators, cloud APIs). The execution layer must be idempotent: running the same remediation twice should not cause problems.

**Verify** - After remediation, check that the issue is resolved. If metrics return to normal within a defined window, close the incident. If the issue persists, escalate to the next remediation option or alert a human.

## AI Components in Self-Healing

**Anomaly detection models** - Time-series models trained on historical metrics data. They learn normal patterns (including daily and weekly cycles, seasonal trends, and expected load variations) and flag deviations. Autoencoders and isolation forests work well for this.

**Root cause analysis with LLMs** - Feed an LLM the current alerts, recent changes (deployments, config changes, scaling events), and relevant logs. Ask it to diagnose the most likely root cause and recommend remediation. The LLM's broad knowledge of infrastructure patterns makes it effective at correlating signals that rule-based systems miss.

**Remediation selection** - A decision model that maps diagnoses to actions. This can be a rule-based system for well-known scenarios, with an LLM fallback for novel situations. The rule-based path is faster and more predictable; the LLM path handles edge cases.

## Safety Boundaries

Self-healing systems must have strict boundaries to prevent automated remediation from causing cascading failures.

**Action allowlists** - Define exactly which actions the system can take. It can restart pods but not delete databases. It can scale up but not scale down below a minimum. It can roll back the last deployment but not deploy new code.

**Blast radius limits** - Cap the scope of automated actions. Restart at most 10% of pods at a time. Scale up by at most 2x. Roll back only if the deployment is less than 2 hours old. These limits prevent well-intentioned but overaggressive remediation.

**Human escalation triggers** - Define conditions that always require human judgment: data loss risk, security incidents, cost implications above a threshold, or any situation the diagnostic engine is not confident about. When in doubt, alert a human.

**Cooldown periods** - After executing a remediation, wait a defined period before allowing another automated action. This prevents thrashing where the system repeatedly applies and reverses actions.

## Getting Started

Start small. Pick one well-understood failure mode with a known remediation (e.g., restarting a pod when it exceeds memory limits). Automate the detection-diagnosis-action-verification loop for that single scenario. Run it in shadow mode (logs decisions but does not act) for two weeks. Review the decisions. When confidence is high, enable automated action. Expand one failure mode at a time.

The goal is not full autonomy. The goal is handling the 80% of routine incidents that follow known patterns, freeing human operators to focus on the novel 20% where their expertise is genuinely needed.
