Prioritization is one of the highest-value applications of AI in operational contexts. When a queue contains more items than can be processed immediately, the order of processing matters. AI scoring allows that order to be determined by a consistent, auditable formula rather than whoever arrived first or whoever called the loudest.

## The Core Problem with Queues

First-in, first-out (FIFO) is not a prioritization strategy - it is an abdication of one. A housing waitlist that processes applications in submission order ignores that some applicants are in immediate danger of homelessness while others are looking to upgrade. A claims queue that processes in arrival order ignores that a disputed EUR 800 claim and a disputed EUR 80,000 claim require very different response times.

Scoring replaces implicit prioritization (order of arrival, who made the most calls) with explicit prioritization based on defined criteria.

## WSJF - Weighted Shortest Job First

WSJF comes from scaled agile frameworks and is particularly useful for prioritizing work items where both value and effort vary. The formula:

**WSJF score = Cost of Delay / Job Duration**

Cost of delay combines: user business value, time criticality, and risk reduction / opportunity enablement. Job duration is the estimated effort to complete the item.

Higher WSJF scores go first: high-value, time-critical, short-duration items get priority over low-value, not-urgent, long-duration items.

In AI systems, WSJF is useful for work queues where items have both a value dimension and a cost dimension. A claims handler's queue scored by WSJF ensures that high-value, time-sensitive claims with fast expected resolution times surface above low-value, non-urgent, complex claims.

Limitation: WSJF requires estimating job duration. If duration estimates are unreliable, the score degrades.

## Opportunity / Effort Matrix

The 2x2 matrix approach classifies items on two dimensions: expected value (high/low) and implementation effort (high/low). The four quadrants are:

- High value, low effort: do first
- High value, high effort: plan carefully, commit with resources
- Low value, low effort: do if capacity allows
- Low value, high effort: do not do

For AI use case selection or feature backlog prioritization, this matrix is more accessible than WSJF because it does not require precise numerical estimates. The scoring is ordinal (relative ranking within quadrants) rather than cardinal.

## Risk-Adjusted Scoring

For queues where the primary concern is managing downside risk - fraud screening, safety referrals, regulatory filings - risk-adjusted scoring weights items by the cost of a miss rather than by positive value.

The formula adjusts baseline priority by: probability of negative outcome (from model or rule scoring) multiplied by severity of that outcome (domain-specific: financial loss, safety risk, regulatory penalty).

A housing application from a family with a documented eviction notice filed two weeks ago scores higher than an otherwise identical application from a family in a stable situation - the cost of missing the urgent case is higher.

## Hybrid Approaches

Most real-world prioritization needs combine multiple dimensions. A common hybrid:

1. Apply hard eligibility rules first (remove ineligible items entirely)
2. Apply emergency flags as overrides (items with critical flags jump to the top regardless of other scores)
3. Score remaining items on a value + time-sensitivity formula
4. Apply a diversity constraint if policy requires it (maximum percentage of any single category in the top N)

The constraints and overrides are explicit policy decisions. They should be documented separately from the scoring model so that policy changes can be made without touching the model.

## Transparency Requirements

Any AI-driven prioritization system in a public-facing context should be able to explain any item's position. "You are ranked 47th because your application date is 2025-08-12, no emergency flag is present, and your household income is 58% of AMI" is an explanation. A raw score of 0.73 is not.

Build the explanation into the scoring output from the start. It is much harder to add after the fact.
