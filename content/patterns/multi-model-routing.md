Not every request needs the most capable model. A simple classification task does not need the same model as a complex reasoning task, and paying for the most expensive model on every request is wasteful. Multi-model routing directs each request to the most appropriate model based on task characteristics.

## Complexity-Based Routing

Route requests to models matched to the task's complexity level.

**Implementation** - A lightweight classifier analyzes the incoming request and assigns a complexity tier. Simple tasks (keyword extraction, binary classification, template-based generation) route to a small, fast model. Medium tasks (multi-step reasoning, nuanced classification) route to a mid-tier model. Complex tasks (long document analysis, creative generation, multi-constraint optimization) route to the most capable model.

**Classifier design** - The routing classifier itself should be fast and cheap. A small model or even a rule-based system (request length, keyword presence, task type header) can serve as an effective router. The classifier does not need to be perfect - occasional misrouting to a more capable model wastes cost but does not reduce quality, while misrouting to a less capable model reduces quality and should be monitored.

**Cost impact** - If 60% of requests are simple, 30% are medium, and 10% are complex, the blended cost per request drops significantly compared to sending everything to the most capable model. Track the actual distribution and cost savings to justify the routing complexity.

## Latency-Based Routing

Route requests based on latency requirements. User-facing synchronous requests need fast responses. Background batch processing can tolerate longer response times from more capable models.

**Implementation** - Tag each request with a latency budget. Requests with tight budgets (under 2 seconds) route to fast models. Requests with relaxed budgets (background processing, email generation, batch analysis) route to models optimized for quality over speed.

**Adaptive routing** - During high-load periods, dynamically route more traffic to faster models to maintain latency SLAs. When load decreases, route more traffic to higher-quality models. This requires real-time load monitoring and dynamic routing rules.

## Fallback Chain Pattern

When the primary model fails (timeout, error, rate limit), automatically fall back to an alternative model rather than returning an error to the user.

**Implementation** - Define an ordered list of models for each task type, ranked by preference. Try the preferred model first. If it fails or exceeds the latency budget, try the next model in the chain. Each fallback may produce slightly lower quality output, but any output is better than an error.

**Graceful degradation** - The fallback output should be clearly usable, even if less optimal. A summarization request that falls back from a large model to a small model should still produce a coherent summary, even if it misses some nuance. Test fallback quality proactively to ensure the degraded experience is acceptable.

**Circuit breaker integration** - If a model is consistently failing, stop sending it traffic (open the circuit breaker) and route directly to the fallback. This prevents cascading latency from repeated timeout-then-fallback sequences. Re-test the primary model periodically to detect recovery.

## Cost-Optimized Routing

Explicitly optimize for cost while maintaining a minimum quality threshold.

**Implementation** - For each request, estimate the cost of processing at each model tier. Route to the cheapest model whose expected quality meets the minimum threshold. This requires historical data on quality by model and request type to make informed routing decisions.

**Budget allocation** - Set a daily or monthly cost budget for AI inference. The router tracks cumulative spend and adjusts routing to stay within budget. When spend is ahead of pace, route more aggressively to cheaper models. When spend is under pace, allow more traffic to higher-quality models.

## Router Monitoring

Multi-model routing adds monitoring requirements beyond single-model systems.

**Key metrics** - Track routing distribution (what percentage goes to each model), quality by model (are cheaper models producing acceptable results), fallback rate (how often the primary model fails), and cost per request (actual vs. target). Alert when the routing distribution shifts unexpectedly, which may indicate a change in input complexity distribution.
