AI systems are only as good as the data that feeds them. Most AI project failures trace back to data problems - not model problems. These patterns address the most common data pipeline challenges in production AI workloads.

## Pattern 1 - Separate Raw, Processed, and Feature Layers

Structure your data lake with three distinct layers:

**Raw layer** - Immutable, append-only storage of data exactly as it arrived from source systems. Never modify raw data. This is your audit trail and recovery point.

**Processed layer** - Cleaned, normalized, deduplicated data in a consistent format. Transformations applied here are deterministic and rerunnable. Schema is enforced.

**Feature layer** - Derived features computed from processed data for model training and serving. Feature logic is versioned. Features used for training are the same features served at inference time - feature stores enforce this consistency.

S3 with prefix-based partitioning implements this pattern well on AWS. Use separate IAM policies per layer to enforce write restrictions on the raw layer.

## Pattern 2 - Event-Driven Incremental Processing

For AI systems that need to process data as it arrives, event-driven pipelines outperform scheduled batch jobs in latency and resource efficiency.

Pattern: S3 upload triggers EventBridge event, which triggers Lambda or Step Functions for processing. Downstream systems are notified when processing completes via SNS or SQS.

This pattern requires idempotent processing steps - the same record processed twice should produce the same output. Design for at-least-once delivery and build idempotency at the processing layer using deduplication keys.

For high-volume streams (thousands of events per second), Amazon Kinesis Data Streams buffers events before processing and allows fan-out to multiple consumers.

## Pattern 3 - Schema Evolution with Backward Compatibility

Data schemas change. Source systems add fields, change data types, rename columns. Pipelines that break on schema change create operational risk.

Design pipelines to be tolerant of additive changes: new fields are ignored if not needed, missing optional fields use defaults. Breaking changes (field removal, type changes) require explicit versioning.

AWS Glue Data Catalog maintains schema versions. Apache Parquet's schema evolution support handles additive changes without pipeline modification. For JSON/semi-structured data, schema validation at ingestion with explicit failure handling prevents malformed records from corrupting downstream datasets.

## Pattern 4 - Data Quality Gates

Insert data quality checks between pipeline stages. A quality gate validates that data meets defined criteria before passing to the next stage. Failed gates halt the pipeline and alert the responsible team.

Useful checks at the ingestion gate: record count within expected range, required fields present, value distributions within historical bounds, no referential integrity violations.

AWS Glue DataBrew and Great Expectations are commonly used frameworks for defining and executing data quality checks. For simpler pipelines, Lambda functions with explicit validation logic are sufficient.

Track data quality metrics over time. Degradation in completeness, schema compliance, or value distribution is often the first signal of a problem in an upstream source system.

## Pattern 5 - Feature Store for Training/Serving Consistency

The most common source of model quality degradation in production is training-serving skew: the features used to train the model differ from the features computed at inference time. Feature stores eliminate this problem by computing features once and serving them to both training pipelines and inference endpoints.

Amazon SageMaker Feature Store provides a managed feature store with online (low-latency) and offline (batch training) access. Features are versioned and point-in-time correct for historical training data retrieval.

Without a feature store, at minimum enforce that training and inference feature code is the same function, tested with the same unit tests, deployed together.

## Pattern 6 - Lineage and Reproducibility

ML model debugging and auditing requires tracing a model output back to the specific training data and pipeline version that produced it. Without lineage, this is impossible.

AWS SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking records: which dataset version was used for training, which pipeline version processed the data, which training job parameters were used, and which model artifact was deployed. This metadata enables full reproducibility and is essential for regulated industries.

For simpler setups, storing experiment configuration (dataset S3 URI with version ID, pipeline code commit hash, training parameters) in experiment tracking tools (MLflow, W&B) provides sufficient lineage for most use cases.
