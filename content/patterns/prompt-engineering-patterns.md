Prompt engineering is the practice of designing inputs to language models to reliably produce useful outputs. In enterprise applications, prompts are not one-off experiments - they are code. They need to be versioned, tested, and maintained. These patterns reflect what works at scale.

## Pattern 1 - Structured Output with JSON Schema

For any application that processes LLM output programmatically, request JSON output with an explicit schema. This is more reliable than parsing natural language responses and fails more gracefully when the model deviates.

Structure the schema request in the prompt: "Return your response as JSON matching this schema: { field: type, ... }". For critical applications, validate the response against the schema before processing and implement a retry with a correction prompt if validation fails.

Modern models (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini) support structured output modes that constrain generation to valid JSON - use these features when available rather than relying on the model's willingness to produce JSON in freeform generation.

## Pattern 2 - Chain-of-Thought for Complex Reasoning

For tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (complex document analysis, classification with nuanced criteria, multi-factor evaluation), instruct the model to show its reasoning before giving a conclusion. This improves accuracy and makes errors detectable.

Standard format: "Think through this step by step. First, [step 1]. Then, [step 2]. Finally, give your conclusion."

In production, you often want only the conclusion, not the reasoning chain. Use a two-call pattern: the first call generates reasoning plus conclusion, the second extracts only the conclusion from the first output. Or use structured output to capture reasoning in a separate field that is not shown to end users.

## Pattern 3 - Few-Shot Examples for Consistency

For classification, extraction, or transformation tasks where you need consistent output format and style, include 2-4 representative examples in the prompt. Examples are more reliable than lengthy description for establishing expected output format.

Example structure:
```
Input: [example input 1]
Output: [expected output 1]

Input: [example input 2]
Output: [expected output 2]

Input: [actual input]
Output:
```

Choose examples that cover the range of variation in your real inputs. One "easy" example and one "edge case" example is a good minimum pair.

## Pattern 4 - System Prompt Separation

In API usage, separate your system prompt (instructions, context, persona) from the user message (the actual input). System prompts define the model's behavior; user messages provide the content to act on.

Keep system prompts focused and under 500 tokens where possible. Longer system prompts dilute attention and can introduce contradictions. For complex applications, structure the system prompt as: role definition, output format specification, constraints and guardrails, and examples.

Version your system prompts explicitly. A change to a system prompt is a code change - it should go through review and testing.

## Pattern 5 - Explicit Guardrails in the Prompt

For enterprise applications, include explicit prohibitions in the system prompt. Do not assume the model will avoid problematic outputs by default. Be specific about what not to do:

- "Do not speculate about information not present in the provided context"
- "Do not generate content involving named individuals unless they appear in the source document"
- "If the answer is not available in the context, say so explicitly rather than generating a plausible-sounding answer"

Pair prompt-level guardrails with Bedrock Guardrails or similar platform-level filtering for defense in depth.

## Pattern 6 - Temperature and Sampling Control

For deterministic tasks (extraction, classification, structured transformation), use temperature 0 or near-0. This maximizes consistency across equivalent inputs.

For creative or generative tasks (drafting, summarization with latitude), temperature 0.3-0.7 produces more varied and natural output.

For production extraction pipelines, always use temperature 0. Variability in extraction results is a defect, not a feature.

## Testing Prompts Like Code

Production prompts require a test suite: a set of representative inputs with expected outputs, run against every prompt change. Track these metrics per prompt version: accuracy on labeled test cases, output format validity rate, latency, and token cost per call. Regression on any metric flags the change for review before deployment.
