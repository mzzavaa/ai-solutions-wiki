Video analysis combines multiple AI capabilities - visual recognition, audio transcription, text detection, and temporal reasoning - into a pipeline that must process hours of content efficiently. The challenge is not any single analysis step but orchestrating them together with aligned timestamps and manageable costs.

## Frame Extraction Strategy

Video is a sequence of frames, but analyzing every frame is wasteful and expensive. The extraction strategy determines the cost-quality tradeoff.

**Fixed-rate extraction** - Extract frames at a constant rate (1 per second, 1 per 5 seconds). Simple to implement. The rate should match the content's visual change frequency. News broadcasts with frequent scene changes need higher rates than surveillance footage.

**Scene-change detection** - Extract frames only when the visual content changes significantly. This produces fewer frames for static content and more frames during rapid visual changes. Reduces cost for content with long static segments while capturing all visual transitions.

**Keyframe extraction** - Many video codecs mark keyframes (I-frames) that represent complete images. Extracting only keyframes aligns with the video's natural structure and avoids blurry or transitional frames.

## Multi-Modal Analysis

Production video analysis processes multiple modalities in parallel.

**Visual analysis** - Object detection, scene classification, face recognition, and text detection (OCR on lower-thirds, signs, and on-screen graphics). Run on extracted frames using computer vision services (Rekognition) or multi-modal LLMs.

**Audio analysis** - Speech-to-text transcription with speaker diarization and language detection. Audio event detection (music, applause, silence) for content segmentation. Run on the extracted audio track.

**Content understanding** - An LLM synthesizes visual and audio analysis results to produce higher-level understanding: topic classification, content summarization, highlight detection, and compliance checking. This step adds the reasoning layer that individual analyses lack.

## Temporal Alignment

All analysis results must align to a common timeline for the combined output to be coherent.

**Timestamp normalization** - Different analysis services report timestamps in different formats and reference points. Normalize all timestamps to a common format (milliseconds from video start) during post-processing.

**Segment alignment** - Align transcript segments with visual analysis results. A transcript segment mentioning a person should align with the visual detection of that person in the corresponding frames. Misalignment degrades the quality of combined metadata.

**Temporal chunking** - For indexing and search, divide the video into time-based segments (30 seconds, 1 minute) with overlap. Each segment gets a composite metadata record combining visual, audio, and content analysis results for that time window.

## Cost Management

Video analysis is expensive because it multiplies per-frame and per-minute costs by content duration.

**Tiered processing** - Process high-value content at full depth and lower-value content at reduced depth. Recent content might get full visual analysis at 1 fps, while archive content gets scene-change detection only.

**Selective analysis** - Not every frame needs every analysis type. Run a cheap scene classifier first, then apply expensive analysis (face recognition, detailed object detection) only to frames classified as containing relevant content.

**Parallel vs. sequential** - Run independent analysis stages in parallel to minimize total processing time. The visual, audio, and metadata extraction stages have no dependencies on each other and should run simultaneously.
