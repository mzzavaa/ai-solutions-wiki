Audio transcription converts speech to text, but a production transcription pipeline needs much more than a single API call. Pre-processing handles audio quality issues, diarization identifies speakers, and post-processing adds punctuation, formatting, and domain-specific corrections.

## Pre-Processing

Raw audio often needs cleanup before transcription for optimal results.

**Format normalization** - Convert audio to the format expected by the transcription service (typically WAV or FLAC at 16kHz mono). Multi-channel audio should be mixed to mono unless per-channel processing is desired (e.g., stereo recordings where each channel is a separate speaker).

**Noise reduction** - Background noise degrades transcription accuracy. Apply noise reduction for audio recorded in noisy environments (field recordings, conference rooms with HVAC, phone calls). Be conservative - aggressive noise reduction can distort speech and reduce accuracy.

**Silence detection** - Long periods of silence (hold music, dead air, pre-meeting chatter) waste processing time and cost. Detect and trim or segment around significant silence periods. Mark silence boundaries in the output for temporal alignment with the original audio.

**Volume normalization** - Inconsistent volume levels (some speakers loud, others quiet) affect recognition accuracy. Normalize audio levels so all speakers are at comparable volume before transcription.

## Transcription Models

**Managed services** - Amazon Transcribe, Google Speech-to-Text, and similar services provide robust transcription with minimal infrastructure management. They handle multiple languages, accents, and audio conditions. Best for most production use cases.

**Specialized models** - Medical, legal, and financial transcription benefit from domain-specific models or custom vocabulary. Amazon Transcribe supports custom vocabularies and custom language models for domain adaptation. Add your industry's terminology to improve accuracy on jargon and technical terms.

**Real-time vs. batch** - Real-time transcription processes audio as it streams, suitable for live captions and real-time analysis. Batch transcription processes complete audio files, typically with higher accuracy because the model can use future context. Use real-time for live applications and batch for recorded content.

## Speaker Diarization

Identifying who spoke when is essential for meeting transcripts, interviews, and multi-party conversations.

**Speaker count** - Some diarization systems require a known speaker count; others detect it automatically. Auto-detection works well for 2-5 speakers but may over-segment or under-segment for larger groups. Provide the speaker count when known.

**Speaker labeling** - Diarization produces numbered speaker labels (Speaker 0, Speaker 1). Map these to actual names using a participant list and voice identification, or prompt users to identify speakers from a short sample. Include speaker labels in the transcript output.

**Cross-talk handling** - When speakers talk simultaneously, diarization accuracy drops. Transcription may miss one speaker's words entirely or assign them to the wrong speaker. Flag cross-talk segments for potential inaccuracy.

## Post-Processing

**Punctuation and formatting** - Many transcription services produce unpunctuated output. Add punctuation, paragraph breaks, and sentence capitalization using an LLM or a dedicated punctuation model. This dramatically improves readability.

**Domain correction** - Transcription services may mis-transcribe domain-specific terms. Build a correction list mapping common misrecognitions to correct terms. Apply corrections as a post-processing step. Track and update the correction list as new misrecognitions are discovered.

**Confidence-based flagging** - Transcription APIs return per-word or per-segment confidence scores. Flag low-confidence segments in the output for human review. Present these segments in a review interface that plays the corresponding audio for easy verification.

**Timestamp preservation** - Maintain word-level or segment-level timestamps throughout post-processing. These timestamps are essential for downstream applications: search results that link to specific moments, subtitle generation, and temporal alignment with other analysis results.
