AI systems that ship without feedback mechanisms stagnate. The feedback loop pattern creates structured channels for capturing user reactions to AI outputs, then uses that signal to improve the system over time. Without this, you are guessing about quality. With it, you have a continuous stream of labeled data showing where the system succeeds and where it fails.

## Types of Feedback

**Explicit feedback** - Users actively signal quality. Thumbs up/down buttons, star ratings, "was this helpful?" prompts. Explicit feedback is high signal but low volume because most users do not bother to click.

**Implicit feedback** - User behavior reveals quality indirectly. Did the user copy the AI's response? Did they edit it before using it? Did they immediately ask a follow-up question rephrasing the same request? Did they abandon the interaction? Implicit signals are lower signal individually but available for every interaction.

**Correction feedback** - Users fix the AI's output. They edit a generated email, correct a classification, or override a recommendation. Corrections are the highest-value feedback because they show both what was wrong and what was right.

## Collection Architecture

Feedback collection requires three components:

**Capture layer** - UI elements that make feedback frictionless. A thumbs-down button should not require a modal dialog explaining why. Make the minimum viable feedback action a single click. Offer optional detail for users who want to provide it.

**Storage layer** - Every AI interaction is logged with its inputs, outputs, and any feedback received. Link feedback to the specific model version, prompt template, and retrieved context that produced the output. Without this linkage, feedback is anecdotal rather than actionable.

**Analysis layer** - Aggregate feedback to identify patterns. Which prompt templates produce the most negative feedback? Which query types have the lowest satisfaction? Which retrieved documents are consistently unhelpful? Regular review of feedback patterns drives targeted improvements.

## Closing the Loop

Collecting feedback without acting on it is worse than not collecting it, because users who provide feedback and see no improvement stop providing it. Close the loop through:

**Prompt refinement** - Negative feedback on specific output types informs prompt template revisions. If users consistently reject overly verbose responses, adjust the prompt to request conciseness.

**Retrieval tuning** - Feedback on RAG systems reveals retrieval failures. When users flag irrelevant information, trace back to the retrieved chunks and adjust indexing, chunking, or ranking.

**Fine-tuning data** - Correction feedback generates training pairs: the original (flawed) output and the user-corrected version. Over time, this builds a dataset for fine-tuning.

**Reporting** - Share feedback trends with stakeholders. A weekly summary of AI quality metrics, grounded in real user feedback, builds organizational confidence in the system and justifies continued investment.

## Privacy Considerations

Feedback data often contains sensitive content. Users correcting AI outputs may include proprietary information. Ensure feedback storage complies with your data retention policies, and anonymize feedback before using it for model improvement when possible.
