Explainability patterns make AI decision-making transparent to the people affected by those decisions. When an AI system denies a loan, flags content for removal, or recommends a medical treatment, the people involved need to understand why. Regulators increasingly require it. Explainability is not a feature you bolt on after deployment - it is an architectural pattern that must be designed in from the start.

## Levels of Explainability

**System-level** - How does the overall system work? What data does it use? What model architecture? What are its known limitations? This level satisfies regulatory documentation requirements and informs stakeholders about the system's general behavior.

**Decision-level** - Why did the system produce this specific output for this specific input? What factors were most influential? What would need to change for a different outcome? This level satisfies individual users who want to understand a decision that affects them.

**Confidence-level** - How certain is the system about this decision? Is this a high-confidence classification or a borderline case? Confidence indicators help users and downstream systems calibrate their trust appropriately.

## Architectural Patterns

**Explanation middleware** - Insert an explanation generation layer between the model and the user. The primary model produces a decision. A separate explanation model (or the same model with a different prompt) takes the decision, the input, and any relevant context and generates a human-readable explanation. This decouples the decision logic from the explanation logic.

**Audit trail logging** - Log every input, model call, intermediate reasoning step, tool call, and output with timestamps and unique identifiers. Store these logs in an immutable, queryable store. When a decision is questioned, the full chain of evidence is available. This is non-negotiable for regulated industries.

**Feature attribution** - For classification and prediction tasks, compute which input features most influenced the output. SHAP values, LIME explanations, and attention weights provide quantitative attribution. Present the top contributing factors alongside the decision: "This application was flagged primarily due to: income-to-debt ratio (42% influence), employment history (28% influence), credit utilization (18% influence)."

**Contrastive explanations** - Explain not just why the decision was made, but what would need to be different for a different outcome. "The application was denied. If the income-to-debt ratio were below 0.4 (currently 0.6), the application would likely be approved." These are more actionable than simple feature attributions.

**Chain-of-thought exposure** - For LLM-based decisions, capture and expose the model's reasoning chain. When the model reasons step by step before reaching a conclusion, the intermediate steps provide a natural explanation. Filter these for relevance and clarity before presenting to users.

## Implementation for LLM Systems

LLMs present unique explainability challenges because they do not have discrete features or weights that can be attributed. Instead:

**Structured reasoning prompts** - Instruct the model to structure its response as: decision, supporting evidence, confidence level, and alternative considerations. This forces the model to produce explanations as part of its primary output rather than as an afterthought.

**Source attribution in RAG** - When using retrieval-augmented generation, include citations to the source documents that informed the response. The user can verify the model's claims against the original sources. This is both an explainability and a trust mechanism.

**Decision decomposition** - For complex decisions, break the process into stages and explain each stage independently. Rather than one opaque decision, present a chain: "Step 1: Classified the request as billing-related (confidence: 0.95). Step 2: Retrieved relevant billing policy. Step 3: Applied policy to the specific case. Conclusion: Refund approved per policy section 3.2."

## Regulatory Context

The EU AI Act requires explanations for high-risk AI decisions. GDPR's right to explanation gives individuals the right to meaningful information about automated decisions. US financial regulators require adverse action notices with specific reasons when AI denies credit. Design your explainability architecture to meet the most stringent regulation you might face, not the least.

## Practical Advice

Start with audit trail logging on day one. It costs little and provides immense value when you need to investigate a decision months later. Layer user-facing explanations on top once you understand which decisions users actually question. Most users do not read explanations for routine positive outcomes; invest explanation quality in adverse or surprising decisions.
