Organizations operating AI systems across multiple jurisdictions must ensure that data stays within its required legal boundaries while still enabling effective model training and inference. This pattern describes the architecture for multi-region data sovereignty.

## Pattern Overview

Deploy region-specific data stores, training infrastructure, and inference endpoints. Data never leaves its jurisdiction of origin unless an explicit, documented transfer mechanism is in place. A global control plane coordinates model versions and configurations across regions without accessing the data itself.

## Data Partitioning Layer

Implement a data routing layer at the point of ingestion that classifies incoming data by jurisdiction and directs it to the appropriate regional data store. Classification is based on the data subject's location, the regulatory requirements of the data type, and any contractual restrictions. Each regional data store is a self-contained environment with its own access controls, encryption keys (managed within the region), and retention policies.

Tag all data with jurisdiction metadata at the point of creation. This metadata follows the data through all processing stages and is enforced by policy controls that prevent data from crossing regional boundaries without authorization.

## Regional Training

Train models within each region using only local data. This produces region-specific models that may have different performance characteristics depending on local data volumes and distributions. For regions with insufficient data, consider these alternatives in order of privacy preference:

**Federated learning** - Train a global model by sending model updates (gradients) across regions rather than raw data. Each region trains locally and shares only the model parameters, which are aggregated centrally. This keeps raw data in its origin region while enabling learning from global patterns.

**Transfer learning** - Train a base model on non-personal or properly consented global data, then fine-tune regional models using local data. The base model can cross borders freely if it was not trained on jurisdiction-restricted data.

**Synthetic data** - Generate synthetic training data that preserves statistical properties of the real data without containing actual personal records. Synthetic data can cross borders, though privacy guarantees should be validated.

## Inference Deployment

Deploy inference endpoints in each region. Route user requests to the nearest compliant region based on the user's jurisdiction, not just geographic proximity. Implement endpoint routing at the CDN or API gateway level. Ensure that inference logs containing personal data (input queries, output predictions) are stored within the same region as the inference endpoint.

## Global Control Plane

A global metadata service coordinates across regions without accessing data. It manages model version synchronization (ensuring all regions run approved model versions), configuration distribution, aggregated performance metrics (anonymized), and compliance reporting. The control plane accesses only metadata, model artifacts (where permitted), and anonymized metrics, never raw personal data.

## Cross-Border Transfer Controls

When transfers are necessary (for example, anonymized performance reports or model artifacts trained on non-personal data), implement automated policy checks that verify the transfer mechanism (SCC, adequacy decision, BCR) before allowing data to cross regional boundaries. Log all cross-border transfers with the legal basis, data categories, and parties involved.

## Infrastructure Implementation

On AWS, use separate accounts per region with SCPs restricting data services to the local region. On Azure, use subscriptions with Azure Policy restricting resource locations. Implement infrastructure as code that parameterizes region-specific configurations. Use cloud-native encryption with region-specific KMS keys that cannot be accessed from other regions.
